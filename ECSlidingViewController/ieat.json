It was good but not good enough that I would pay $35 for it. ", " But, if you are a fan of Ruth's Chris and have had these dishes as a staple when you were overseas, I think you would be quite happy to see them on the menu.", "The steaks, I have no complaints.\u00a0 They were excellent.\u00a0 Ruth's Chris signature style of serving them on plates heated to 260 degrees C means that restaurant is filled with the wonderful aroma of beef and butter and a seductive sizzling sound whenever someone's steak makes its way from the kitchen to the table.", "They serve Midwestern USDA Prime Beef steaks and have a proprietary broiler that heats up to nearly 1000 degrees C which blasts the steaks into a blistering brazen char.\u00a0 No fancy pansy, Sous Vide gentle cooking techniques here.\u00a0 This is good old cowboy food.\u00a0 Sirloin cooked in a way to make your testosterone surge through your veins and directly into your loins, Sir.\u00a0 I ordered my steaks medium rare and they arrived at the table still sizzling but perfectly cooked - medium rare. ", "Because of AVA's restrictions on US beef cut with the bone attached, the T Bone steaks had to be sourced from Australia.\u00a0 They managed to get a grade 5 Wagyu T Bone which has the texture and flavour that is quite similar to the USDA beef.\u00a0 So both my Ribeye and T Bone steaks tasted quite similar and they were done perfectly medium rare.\u00a0 My choice is to go for the Ribeye since my favorite part of the cow is the Ribeye Cap, but if you are sharing a steak with a friend who doesn't have a big appetite, the 640g T Bone is actually quite adequate for sharing. ", "The people at Ruth's Chris tell me that they only use salt and pepper to season the steaks before grilling and when the steaks are ready, they are served on butter and chopped parsley.\u00a0 So you get to taste the real flavour of the beef rather than the seasoning rubs that some other places might add to spice up the flavour of lesser quality beef.\u00a0 That said, they still provide some dipping sauces on request, but I feel that they are excellent just as they are without the need for extra dipping sauces. ", "The style at US steakhouses is that you always have to order your sides separately.\u00a0 So your $85++ only gets you that piece of meat.\u00a0 If you want fries with it, you have to order separately.\u00a0 This is where it can really add to the cost of your full meal as the sides are priced $20 and above.\u00a0 The portions are quite big, so a bowl of mashed potatoes can be shared between two or three.\u00a0 Still, $20 plus is a lot to pay for a plate of fries, mashed potatoes or steamed veggies.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "", "The desserts are another highlight of Ruth's Chris and again, they are big portions which are easily enough for two.\u00a0 The Cheesecake in particular is very good.\u00a0 Again, it is classic, old school Cheesecake but done very well and worth the extra calories if you still have the stomach for it after your huge steak!\u00a0", "If you are looking for the good old American Beef Steak, this is the place to find it.\u00a0 The meat here is excellent and their 1000 degree broiler gives the steak more than just a decent char.\u00a0 It's good to come to a place which still believes in serving steaks on a sizzling hot plate as the restaurant is filled with that wonderful beefy steakhouse aroma.\u00a0 Even though it is a high end fine dining place, the atmosphere is casual enough for family dining.\u00a0 Don't get carried away ordering starters and sides as they can add a substantial amount to the final bill!", "Ruth's Chris Steak House", "Marina Mandarin Singapore", "6 Raffles Boulevard, Level 4", "Singapore 039594 ", "Tel: 6336 9093", "11.30am \u2013 3pm, 5.30pm \u2013 11pm", "This was a media invited review ", ""], "title": "Ruth's Chris Steak House", "image": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rQPoFC_5F2A/UDRE00hOrmI/AAAAAAAATQQ/0MCg5pnK2BA/s800/Starters.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H4QEygsiX_0/UDREz5hA7sI/AAAAAAAATQI/UnMnk6e2e2s/s640/Ribeye+Steak.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KLyw2Pp7bvc/UDRE1lTswhI/AAAAAAAATQY/02PrAyrEM3k/s800/T+Bone+Steak.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W_jmDDI18JI/UDRE2UeJD6I/AAAAAAAATQg/3mRlMnV5GHE/s800/cheese+Cake.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-odJEBUPh-rc/UDREy0SW48I/AAAAAAAATQE/ByqQvBxcX7M/s200/Restaurant.jpg"], "foodtype": "", "longitude": 103.8585828, "source": "ieatishootipost", "link": "http://ieatishootipost.sg/2012/08/crab-cakes-2-per-serving-and-bbq-shrimp.html", "location": "Singapore 039594", "latitude": 1.2919404, "titlefull": "Ruth's Chris Steak House:  Dependable, Straightfoward and Awfully Good Steaks!"},

Legend has it that the Minangkabau (lit Victory over the Buffalo) are so named because of a famous battle between their tribe and the forces of the Majapahit empire.\u00a0 Instead of an all out war, both sides decided to send a water buffalo to settle their dispute.\u00a0 The prince of the Majapahit empire sent a huge beast while the Minangkabau sent a hungry buffalo calf with knives strapped to its horns.\u00a0 During the ensuing battle, the baby buffalo went straight for the udders of the big buffalo and pierced its belly while looking for milk!", "So the buffalo is a very significant animal for the Minangkabau and it is reflected in the architecture of their ", " as well as in their food.\u00a0 Beef rendang is traditionally made with buffalo meat and its a dish that is often cooked during festive occasions.\u00a0 Traditionally, Beef Rendang is cooked for a long time until it is all dried up and can be kept for a whole month without refrigeration.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "I was told by Hazmi that there are many styles of Rendang served in Singapore, but their version is close to the authentic Minangkabau version.. The recipe belonged to his grandmother, Hajjah Rosemah, who migrated from Minangkabau to Singapore in the 1940's and started a Nasi Padang stall along Kandahar St.\u00a0 They then shifted to a rental coffeeshop in the 70's where it was known as Nasi Padang Batu Nisan (lit Nasi Padang tombstone) because of its proximity to a tombstone maker.\u00a0 It was this stall that gave birth to Rumah Makan Minang, Sebar Menanti and ", ",\u00a0 all of which are located within walking distance from each other in Kampung Glam.\u00a0 Even ", ", which is a stone's throw away belongs to Hazmi's Uncle!\u00a0\u00a0 ", "I have always enjoyed Beef Rendang with nice, tender, melt in your mouth beef from ", ". However, I was told that authentic Beef Rendang is supposed to have a bit of a chew so that the flavour develops in your mouth.\u00a0 It is also supposed to be spicy as it is characteristic of Minangkabau food.\u00a0 So the Beef Rendang here tends to be more dry and chewy and the spices do pack a punch. Good for those whose palates are used to really spicy food.

Still its something you might like to order just to try something new and different.

During the 50's however, the most popular form was the Black version made from steamed rice cakes without radishes.\u00a0 This was known as Char Kueh (Fried Rice Cakes) rather than Chai Tau Kueh (Carrot Cake).\u00a0 During the post war years, Char Kueh was simply rice cakes fried without eggs or chye poh and Sweet Soy Sauce was the cheap and convenient means of adding flavour.", "It is believed that Lau Goh was one of the earliest pioneers of White Carrot Cake.\u00a0 He started making his rice cakes with shredded radishes and fried it without adding Sweet Soy Sauce. There was no Chye Poh (preserved radish) either and people would bring their own duck eggs for Lau Goh to fry with the Carrot Cake.\u00a0 In those days, the Carrot Cake was cut with a string into long rectangular fingers, quite unlike the Carrot Cake you see nowadays.\u00a0 In the 70's, Lau Goh was chased off the streets and relocated to a permanent stall at People's Park Centre.

In case you feel too lazy to read through the requirements for ", ", let me try to sum it up for you.", "First, the pizza needs to be baked in a wood fired oven in temperatures of more than 800 degrees F (426 degrees C) and the cooking time must not exceed 60 to 90 seconds.  The consistency of the pizza base should be soft, elastic and bendable and the toppings should consist of tomato sauce made from San Marzano tomatoes, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella either Buffalo mozzarella DOP (ie from the region of Campania) in the case of Vera Pizza Margherita Extra, or Fior de Latte (fresh mozzarella made from cow's milk) for Vera Pizza Margherita and finished with a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil.\u00a0 You can see from the video that our Japanese Pizzaiolo has been very meticulous in adhering to the requirements.", "To see just how close they got to the original Vera Pizza Napoletana, check out the next video which was filmed at Pizzeria Da Michele, widely regarded as THE pizzeria to visit in Naples and the one I shall be eating at one day ....

The difference I see is perhaps that the pizzas at da Michele is more charred and is slightly larger than the one made at L'Operetta, but otherwise, the process and final product looks pretty similar.", "Now, it is one thing to have a certified Vera Pizza Napoletana, but the real question is, does it taste as awesome as what it is all made out to be? To be absolutely honest, the pizza is great but I am still uncertain if the taste experience is the same as the Pizzas at da Michele. The problem is that I have never had the opportunity to eat at Pizzaria da Michele, and so far, I can only imagine what it must taste like by looking at the videos and rely on friends like Damien who tells me that this is the closest pizza to the ones in Naples that he has come across in Singapore.\u00a0 So I guess I was slightly dissappointed that the pizzas haven't brought me to the moment of Epiphany I was expecting.\u00a0 But until I get to Naples, this is the next best thing!

", "The difference lies in the special wood fired oven from Naples.\u00a0 In  order to achieve a soft and chewy crust with toppings that are not  overcooked, the pizzas need to be cooked very quickly and this requires a  super hot oven capable of reaching temperatures close to 500 degrees  Celcius. Mizutani San was telling me about how much trouble he had  trying to install the 2300 kg oven into his kitchen!\u00a0 This high  temperature is achieved because the oven is made using the volcanic  rocks excavated from the quarries near Mount Vesuvius.\u00a0 This high  temperature is what makes the pizza charred on the outside while the  inside is still slightly moist and chewy and the tomatoes are not  cooked too long so that they lose that tangy zest and the cheese has  just melted such that they still retain their shape and don't lose that  chewy stringiness.\u00a0 The character of fresh Mozzarella is that it is at  its chewiest when it is just melted, once cooking is prolonged, it goes  past that chewy state and becomes less stringy.\u00a0 This is the reason why  when I cook pizzas at home in a 250 degrees Celcius oven, I always add the  Mozarella just one or two minutes before the pizza comes out of the  oven!", "The pizzas at L'Operetta are all priced between  $20 for the Margharita to $28 for the Calzone, so the prices are  surprisingly affordable given all the effort of procuring a true Napoli  oven and using real wood to fire it!\u00a0 They are definitely upping the  game for pizzerias in Singapore and this is an exciting development for  all pizza lovers here!", "I can't end this post without a comment on the overall design of the restaurant.\u00a0 In true Japanese style, they have really overdone the decor such that it has that sense of garish opulence.\u00a0 So when they think Italian, they think Michaelangelo and they put a huge  painting of \"creation\" that covers one whole wall in the restaurant! I guess it feels perfectly fine when you know that this is an Italian restaurant run by the same people (ie Japanese) who came up with Iron Chef, Ninja Warrior and Cosplay.\u00a0 It anyone else did it, it would just feel contrived.", "I am very excited to find a pizzeria gunning for Vera Pizza Napoletana.\u00a0 Very soon Singapore will become the Pizza Mecca for South Asia if it isn't already so now.\u00a0 If like me, you have been planning to visit Naples for the original Pizza, then here is an excellent preview of what it is going to be like!

I was expecting the owners of this little stall in Beauty World Food Centre to be Shanghainese, but it turns out that they are a new generation of migrants from Xiamen (Fujian province).\u00a0 However, instead of making Poh Piah which is what their Hokkien forefathers brought to Singapore, they decided to make Xiao Long Bao instead.\u00a0 ", "Why do people from the province of Fujian want to sell Shanghainese cuisine?\u00a0 This was the question I posed to the Lao Ban Niang (Lady Boss).\u00a0 The answer is very simple.\u00a0 She loves to eat Xiao Long Bao and saw an opportunity for business.\u00a0 They had arrived 15 years ago as factory workers. But slowly they managed to save enough to start their own business.\u00a0 And just like our early migrant fathers, they encompass the entrepreneurial spirit, putting in every ounce of sweat into each Xiao Long Bao. But that is not the reason why each dumpling is so full of soup. In order to get the soup in the dumpling, it has to be made separately and chilled so that it turns to jelly, then added back into the meat filling.\u00a0 The heat of the steam then turns the jelly back into liquid form to give you that burst in your mouth feeling.", "So how do you gauge a good Xiao Long Bao?\u00a0 The Lao Ban Niang here told me that firstly, you should look at the number of folds in the dumpling.\u00a0 Typically, it should have at least 18 folds, but she makes sure that each of her Xiao Long Baos have more than 20.\u00a0 Then when they arrive steaming hot, you should be able to see the liquid through the skin.\u00a0 This tells you the skin is thin enough.\u00a0 Next, you should be able to pick it up with your chopsticks such that it doesn't break.\u00a0 For the first Xiao Long Bao, test to see how much soup is contained in the dumpling by biting a small hole on the side and draining the soup into your soup spoon.\u00a0 There should be at least half of a soup spoonful.\u00a0 Finally when you eat the dumpling, the meat filling must not be mushy but have a certain amount of bounce in it and of course it must taste good.\u00a0 Based on all these criteria, this Xiao Long Bao scores a ", " from me.\u00a0 The only minor thing I would say is that the skin at the top of the dumpling tasted just slightly floury.\u00a0 ", "The Guo Tie was also surprisingly good.\u00a0 In fact, I was even more impressed with the Guo Tie than I was with the Xiao Long Bao. It was easily the best Guo Tie I have taken before, although I must qualify that I have not been on my Guo Tie hunt just yet.\u00a0 But just based on taste alone, the skin had just the right amount of chew with a very nice sweetness at the end and the meat filling was fragrant and there texture was great and there was a fair amount of soup inside which made it very juicy.\u00a0 ", "If you want something sweet to end with, I would recommend the Redbean Pancake. Ok, to be perfectly honest, I have never tasted a Redbean pancake I didn't like.\u00a0 But I have usually eaten these at the usual Shanghainese cuisine restaurants like Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure and this one is just as good.\u00a0 ", "Selling Xiao Long Bao in a hawker centre is a brilliant idea.\u00a0 Lot of tables that day had ordered some Xiao Long Bao to accompany whatever they were eating.\u00a0 Xiao Long Bao has really come a long way from being a foreign cuisine into something that is embraced by Singaporeans.\u00a0 If you are hankering for some informal Xiao Long Bao, this is certainly one place you can check out.\u00a0 ", "You Peng Fresh Mian Jiao Zi Guan", "114, Upper Bukit Timah,", "Beauty World Centre, #04-23", "Singapore 588177", "10.30am to 9pm", "92391598 Ms Chia", "64635608", ""], "title": "You Peng Fresh Mian Jiao Zi Guan", "image": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kTjrYP_Z7ro/TYgbP8QhGjI/AAAAAAAANao/sxysK8CCwJc/s800/Xiao+Long+Bao.jpg", "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kd_CnlGJ_D0/TYgbPGhD5hI/AAAAAAAANak/AYsSRqG4P0o/s800/Xiao+Long+Bao+unsteamed.jpg", "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KN7qepDgT8E/TYgbObvUitI/AAAAAAAANag/cnV3yk2mIyw/s800/Xiao+Long+Bao+Soup.jpg", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CchRkoFGB-E/TYgbKQ63sEI/AAAAAAAANaU/3vmAtr5Iy6U/s800/Guo+Tie.jpg", "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-N1F8IOaAqTM/TYgbL8eY06I/AAAAAAAANaY/HufCwzCEYFI/s800/Redbean+pancake.jpg", "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GBXyeOZWGXU/TYgbNmXnWQI/AAAAAAAANac/_mPF0G2lg04/s200/Stall.jpg"], "foodtype": "", "longitude": 103.7767119, "source": "ieatishootipost", "link": "http://ieatishootipost.sg/2011/03/you-peng-fresh-mian-jiao-zi-guan-xiao.html", "location": "Singapore 588177", "latitude": 1.3421558, "titlefull": "You Peng Fresh Mian Jiao Zi Guan: The Xiao Long Bao Test"},

So when I finally decided to visit recently, I was amazed to find that the reviews on the restaurant has been rather lack lustre over the last year or so. You might have felt the same way if you had visited the restaurant. So what happened? ", "I met up with Chef Thomas, who was helming the restaurant when it first opened in 2009.  He told me that right after the restaurant won the award, he left to run another of his restaurants in Vietnam.\u00a0 During his absence,\u00a0Hokkaido Sushi began to\u00a0falter and so\u00a0after two\u00a0years, he has returned to\u00a0take over management of Hokkaido Sushi recently.", "Nowadays I divide Sushi restaurants into two different types. The ones which I go eat with my kids for fun and those which I leave the kids at home so that I can have a serious Sushi experience. Whenever I go out for family Sushi, I find myself eating stuff like inari (bean curd skin) and soft shell crab rolls.  The kids enjoy the conveyor belt experience but I seldom touch the raw fish.  It was the sushi belt that kept me away from sushi for so long. I only got to like raw fish after I ate Sushi at a Sushi bar.  In all honesty, I still think a nice fishhead steamboat or steamed pomfret has got more \"shiok\" in it then eating raw fish.  However, what I do enjoy about Sushi is learning to appreciate the nuances and textural differences between different seafood species.  As opposed to wolfing down a whole plate of fish, when you have to focus your entire attention on one mouthful of fish, it really does sharpen your taste buds. ", "The Sushi Omakase course here starts with a salad, followed by three types of appetizers.  We were given some dried leatherjacket, dried fugu and this very interesting egg omelette where they white is first separated from the yolk, done tamago yaki (rolled omelette) style and then the yolks were steamed and crumbled on top.  Tastes like hard boiled egg except that the white is sweet, fluffy and tender.  It's amazing new take on the humble egg.  ", "After the appetizer comes the sashimi course and we were presented with Sayori or halfbeak which is a fish that comes into season at springtime.  This little fish looks like something I would catch in order to put on a hook to catch bigger fish. But after tasting it, I think I might keep it for myself next time.  Eaten with freshly grated young ginger and shallots, it tasted almost like chicken rice..... seriously.   It's amazing how the ginger brought out the savoury tones of the fish which would be missing if you omit the ginger. Definitely something I would order again.\u00a0 ", " ", "After the sashimi course, we were presented with 15 different types of Sushi. We had the usual suspects of Kanpachi (Greater Amberjack), Shima aji (striped jack), maguro (tuna) and Uni (sea urchin)\u00a0etc.  They were all very fresh and I plan to write a separate series of blog posts on them.  For now I shall just highlight a few of the more interesting ones we had that night.\u00a0 ", "Part of the fun of sitting at the Sushi Bar is the interaction between you and the Itamae (Sushi Chef).  In fact, most Sushi aficionados probably have favourite places they go to, not just because the sushi is good, but more because they are familiar with the Itamae.  This is of course a bit of a problem if you don't speak the same language as the Itamae.  At Hokkaido Sushi, you won't have the same problem since both Chef Thomas and Patrick can speak Hokkien to you if you like.  So eating at the bar is quite relaxing as you can banter with the chefs and Chef Thomas in particular, especially\u00a0adapt at livening things up.\u00a0 ", "One of the things he did was to slam this piece of Tako (Octopus) onto his chopping board to show us that it was still \"alive\".  He told us that when you cut off the tentacles of the Octopus, they will actually still be squirming around for a pretty long time.  He served the Tako atop the rice with some lemon juice on top.  I have never had fresh octopus before and it was amazing how sweet it was!  Normally Tako has to be served cooked because of the risk of parasites.  But Chef Thomas told me that you can eat it raw if you remove the suckers.\u00a0(I am still ok as\u00a0at the time of this writing)\u00a0 ", "I have always found cooked Saba (Japanese Mackeral) a bit too fishy for my liking, so when Chef Thomas told me that he was giving me Nama (fresh) Saba, I was a little apprehensive.  But as it turned out, fresh Saba was actually pleasantly sweet and not as fishy as the cooked version.  This tane (topping) is always served with a sliver of the bluish skin with wavy black lines so that it is easily identified.  It must be noted that Saba spoils quickly and must be eaten super fresh or it might result in scombroid poisoning.  Not bad, but I will have to eat this a couple more times before I can rate it.", "Anago (Conger Eel) is one of the first sushi that I actually liked.  Being a cooked dish, it is one of the best Sushi to try if you are new to it.  But you should never ask for Anago first because it is a fish that has been braised in shoyu, so if you have it at the beginning of your sushi course, it will dull your tastebuds to the the rest of the raw items.  It is usually given towards the end of the course.  The key to anago is the texture.  One that is done well should be tender and creamy.  Chef Thomas has been known to be rather generous with his anago.  The photo shown here is exceptionally generous because we were quite full already so instead of two portions of rice, he reduced it to one with the same amount of topping.  The taste is excellent and the flesh is tender and creamy. Definitely an item you should ask for.\u00a0 ", "Most King Crab is steamed first and served cold. Chef Thomas perfers to grill it instead and so even though the flesh has contracted somewhat, the slight smokey aroma together with the sweet warm flesh really brought out the best in the King Crab.  So simple, yet so good.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "The Sushi course ends with something warm and savoury. In our case, we were given some beef and shitake mushroom in teriyaki sauce.  A nice way to provide some contrast to all the raw food and to finish the meal with something that will take care of the need for something warm and savoury .  It's good, but nothing unexpected.\u00a0 ", "Part of the fun of eating at the bar is to be able to interact with the itamae and I think that you will find it very comfortable sitting at the bar here.

Whampoa Keng uses Dao Chior (Chinese Pomfret) for the soup which is more expensive than Peh Chior (Silver Pomfret).\u00a0 The Dao Chior is a larger fish, so the flesh is more substantial and better for soups.\u00a0 Whampoa Keng doesn't make a distinction between fish head and sliced fish, so you don't have to worry about having to make that decision.\u00a0 But in general, soup made from fish head is sweeter and if you enjoy sucking on soft jellylike bits, then go for the head.\u00a0 However, when it comes to Pomfret, the head is so small that no one really offers pomfret head soup, unless you are serving the Emperor of China.", "Ah, here is another decision you have to make.\u00a0 What do you do with the fried yam?\u00a0 Eat it just like that or mash it up and drink it with the soup?\u00a0 Lao Ban Niang's personal preference is the mash it up and drink it with the soup and having tried it, I am very much in agreement with the Teochew Ah Nia (Teochew lady). The ingredients might seem like a random mix of fish and other stuff but according to Doris, each ingredient plays an important role in the overall taste of the soup, so it is the attention to the little details which produces a soup that is well balanced.\u00a0 Take the sour plums for instance, there may only be one or two per pot, but if omitted, the soup will lack that little tang that helps get your salivary glands going.\u00a0 Needless to say, the fish has to be really fresh and the yam has to come from Thailand where it is \"Shang shang\" (powdery).\u00a0 All of our kakis agree that the soup was excellent.\u00a0 ", "", "Now, you might be a little confused with the number of steamboat places name Whampoa and I don't blame you.\u00a0 So to clear up the confusion, here is the story.\u00a0 Before Whampoa market and food centre was renovated, there were three stalls there selling Fishhead steamboat.\u00a0 Our Lao Ban Niang started by selling Kway Chap before changing to Fish Head Steamboat and she was the latest of the three stalls there.\u00a0 Of the three stalls, two were more popular.\u00a0 The original Fishhead Steamboat stall which occupied the fresh food market side and hers.\u00a0 When they closed the market for renovations, they moved to their own premises at Balestier and renamed it Whampoa Keng, Keng being the name of the golden haired anime looking Lao Ban (Boss) who not only has to look after two restaurants, but two wives as well.\u00a0 More about him later.\u00a0 ", "Now, you wouldn't want to just come here to drink soup right?\u00a0 You also want to order a few dishes which are preferably deep fried (since fish soup is so healthy, you need some deep fried stuff to balance your diet).\u00a0 They have a few signature dishes here which we tried.\u00a0 One was the ever popular Har Cheong Gai (prawn paste chicken) which was well marinated, hot and juicy.\u00a0 The marinade is very balance and it would have been perfect if the coating of batter were just a bit more even.\u00a0 ", "Most of our kakis also liked their handmade Ngor Hiang which was made with fresh sea prawns that they de-shell themselves.The meat and prawn filling was plump and juicy and even though the prawns were minced a bit too fine for my liking, the crunchiness of the water chestnut more than made up for it. ", "We were recommended to try the Indonesian chicken which is deep fried nuggets of chicken coated with a sweet, sour and spicy prawn paste sauce.\u00a0 This is good as the chicken pieces were fried fresh so that they were still plump and juicy.\u00a0 Aside from the Indonesian style sauce, the marmite sauce is also great and you can choose pork ribs or chicken.\u00a0 You can mix and match any of these combination and they will satisfy your craving for\u00a0 deep fried meat in sweet, sour, savory and spicy sauce.

I have been wanting to organize a session where you can get the chance to try his dishes and I am glad that I have finally managed to work something out!", "Chef Tim had recently taken up the post as Chef de Cuisine at the Garage and has attracted quite a flurry of excitement in the media. When he was planning his menu back in June, I told him that he MUST have a burger on the menu because I like burgers and I wanted to see what he kind of burger he would come up with. So this is what he created.\u00a0 A chopped Wagyu Rump pattie, topped with seared foie gras, glazed with homemade tomato ketchup (he hates the commercial version) on a homemade mini bun (he doesn't like to buy them).\u00a0 He doesn't spread butter on the toasted buns.\u00a0 That would be too simple. He makes it more elaborate by serving the burgers over Hollandaise sauce which serves as a dip for the burger.\u00a0 Needless to say, these are bitefuls to savour which were simply constructed but carefully made.\u00a0 ", "Sous Vide (pronounced soo veed) cooking is becoming quite fashionable now.\u00a0 Tim likes this form of cooking because he can really control the temperature precisely in order to get the texture of the meat just right.\u00a0 The Wagyu Rump is placed in a plastic bag, vacuum sealed and placed in a water bath at a controlled temperature for 2.5 hours.\u00a0 At the end of the process, the whole piece of meat would have cooked nice and medium rare all the way through (As you can see from the photo).\u00a0 Just before serving, he sears the meat to create that nice flavoursome crust (it's the Maillard reaction to be precise not caramelisation).\u00a0 But to just serve you this piece of perfectly cooked meat would be too easy.\u00a0 Over at one corner of the dish he hides a puck of braised oxtail, over the other corner is some cherry tomato chutney and interspersed in between are discs of potato confit and mushroom puree.\u00a0 It's like playing treasure hunt on a plate.", "It is not enough just to serve you a piece of lamb, even though it had been seared beautifully and quite frankly can be enjoyed on its own. The lamb rump was paired with rolls of lamb belly which reminded me of those rolled char siew you get at Ramen joints.\u00a0 The lamb belly has been salted, rolled and wrapped in clingwrap before being slow cooked in a water bath for 18 hours.\u00a0 They are then sliced thin and seared to create a crispy crust.\u00a0 It is served on a bed of Jerusalem artichoke ecresse which is basically a chunky puree of Jerusalem artichoke and a pea and tomato vinaigrette. The lamb belly bacon is a \"must try\" in my books.", "Tim enjoys progressive cooking (ie he likes to play with his food), and experiments with changing the texture and appearance of common ingredients in order to give it that element of surprise.\u00a0 For dessert he showed us his \"raspberries\" which were raspberries served with tea spheres. He tells us that he used a reverse spherification process to create a semi-permeable membrane to encapsulate the tea so that when you put it in your mouth, it bursts like an egg yolk.\u00a0\u00a0 This is topped with dehydrated croutons and a creme anglaise which has so many vanilla seeds that you can feel the grits between your teeth.\u00a0 ", "I haven't rated the dishes today because this post really isn't a review.\u00a0 It's just to let you know about what dishes to expect when you come for this special tasting session.\u00a0 For readers who have been watching our videos, this is your chance to get to meet Tim in person and let him introduce you to his idea of what food should taste like.\u00a0 I am confident (more like awed) with his culinary ability and I will let you rate his food instead.", "Tim is looking forward to meeting you all, so he has agreed to host up to four tables (ie 8 diners every night from Sep 8th till Sep 11th.\u00a0 All you need to do is to make reservations at Garage under ieatishootipost and print out this post in order to enjoy one appetizer and two main courses for $85 nett (that's for 2 pax). \u00a0 Tim will come out to meet you and let you try some of his other experimental dishes on the house!\u00a0 Now that would be interesting don't you think?", "Please note that seats are limited as he will only host\u00a0 4 tables (8 diners) per night for four nights, so do make your reservations early!

It was an unexpected dish since we usually order the Curry Chicken.\u00a0 The gravy was eye openingly good and the prawns were the fresh sea prawns which were big and succulent. I was told that their curry takes three days to prepare, from the preparation of the ingredients, to the grinding, to the frying of the rempah and finally cooking the curry.\u00a0 The rempah forms the curry base for all their curry dishes.\u00a0 The prawn curry was fragrant and has a natural sweetness that got me lapping it up and thinking of when I am going back again.\u00a0 ", "Unlike the Nonya version, the Hainanese Chap Chye sold at these hawker stalls is very simple.\u00a0 Of course, when my mother-in-law cooks Chap Chye, there is a lot more stuff in the dish.\u00a0 But at these Hainanese Curry Rice places, Chap Chye means cabbage that has been cooked till they are slimy and soft and when you order just one plate of rice with the dishes on top, they will use this superbly slimy concoction as a topping together with the curry and braising sauce.\u00a0 The Chap Chye here is ok but nothing exceptional on its own. However, it plays a large supporting role in the whole Hainanese Curry Rice experience.\u00a0 ", "Although Mr Loo told me that the Kong Bak was an adaptation of Babi Ponteh, I can't help but think that since Kong Bak is a common dish even amongst the other dialect groups that it is probably something quite generic.\u00a0 The Kong Bak here is certainly very different from the Nonya version and looks and taste more like the Teochew variety.\u00a0 Again, eaten by itself, it is nothing to rave about.\u00a0 It is like listening only to the cello in a three string orchestra. But it resonates synergistically with the Curry and Chap Chye to become a melodious Hainanese symphony.\u00a0 ", "I know that three of the four dishes only scored 4/5 but this is still a place which I would go back again and again to eat the curry rice.\u00a0 It is just the combination of the dishes and the whole environment that makes it a great place to enjoy Hainanese Curry Rice.\u00a0 That said, I think I would have had a much better meal if I had gone there before 12pm when the Pork Chops are still coming out fresh from the fryer!", "Thanks to Sen for video link!", ""], "title": "Loo's Hainanese Curry Rice", "image": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_II8xB8Ke_u4/TIYf17h-rkI/AAAAAAAAM0U/mX0mTC7i1Lw/s800/Pork+Chops.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_II8xB8Ke_u4/TIYf0ei1JcI/AAAAAAAAM0E/aXkcznyRPrM/s800/Curry+Prawns.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_II8xB8Ke_u4/TIYfzSn7-eI/AAAAAAAAMz8/ny6nZn9Lkr8/s800/Chap+Chye.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_II8xB8Ke_u4/TIYf1dVvWpI/AAAAAAAAM0M/8X3gnPcICiM/s800/Loh+Bak.jpg"], "foodtype": "", "longitude": 0, "source": "ieatishootipost", "link": "http://ieatishootipost.sg/2010/09/loos-hainanese-curry-rice-how-did.html", "location": "unknown", "latitude": 0, "titlefull": "Loo's Hainanese Curry Rice:  How did Hainanese Curry  Rice come to be?"},

Perhaps mom was right after all and eating fish is good for your brains!", "We Teochews are probably most famous for our fresh fish which we cook by simply steaming it or alternatively, boiling it quickly in a cauldron of preserved vegetables (Chye Bueh). If you go at around closing time, the vat of simmering \"Chye Bueh\" would have been used to as a spa for hundreds of fresh fish and has turned into a really sweet and tangy soup.

Firstly, what we want to see is the \"Swa ga Hai\" (Mountain and Sea) which basically means that the porridge is watery but not overly watered down.  Secondly, the rice must remain whole and unbroken.  The best Teochew Muay places throw away the pot of porridge when the rice breaks.", "If you think that those Japanese Rutan (Seasoned Eggs) with its watery yolks are new to the Singapore food scene, think again.  This stall has been selling this style of eggs for over a generation!  I don't know why but this is the only Teochew Porridge stall that sells their Lou Nerng (Seasoned eggs) this way.  What is commonly seen is the hard boiled version which often has that ugly, smelly green grey ring around it because they have overcooked the yolks.  Most of the time stallholders actually buy the eggs already hardboiled and then put them into the braising sauce.  So if you love the Japanese Charshu Ramen eggs, then here is where you can get it cheap!

He was most famous back in the eighties when he was dishing out $15 bowls of claypot Hokkien Mee and people were lapping it up without complaining.  Those were the Food Nazi days.

Then there is the question over the number of different stalls which have sprouted up across the island with the same brand name. Are they genuine Kim's or is there a family tussle over the brand name.  And where is Kim nowadays?", "These questions were always at the back of my mind whenever I drive past a Kim's outlet.  As luck would have it, I drove past the stall along Jalan Eunos one day and spied a man frying Hokkien Mee wearing a long sleeve shirt!  Ah, could this be my chance to get to the bottom of this mystery?", "Mr Tan turned out to be quite a personable man who is not shy of the camera and yes, he was wearing his gold Rolex and long sleeve shirt. So I asked him the $69,000 question.  What happened in the 80's?  What brought down the Kim empire?  Was it the gambling or the bickering wives? (Yes, I actually asked him that)", "Well, what he told me turned out to be relatively mundane.  At the peak of Kim's popularity, he bought a building  in Geylang (Kim's) which lost him a lot of money because one of the groundfloor tenants who was supposed to move out did not.  As a result of the financial disaster he decided to retire for a while.  Oh yes, he also said categorically that he only has one wife.", "Kim's now operates a number of stalls all over the island.

Do tell us your version of the story.", "Kim's hokkien mee is pre-fried and left to rest and refried when you order your plate.

Those who like the thick bee hoon, wet style Hokkien Mee would be happy with this Hokkien Mee.  The other commendable item is the wonderfully fresh and crunchy lard bits which will not disappoint lard lovers. It could have been even better if they still included the pork belly and fried the noodles a little more to get all that nice flavor in.

So I had them fry another plate of hor fun for me with wok hei.", "The state of Hor Fun in Singapore is pretty lack lustre nowadays and this one stands out as one of the best one I have eaten so far.

Perhaps I need to persuade the \"old hand\" to come out of retirement to fry one for me?", "The Hor Fun here is sold out everyday because they order fresh Hor Fun daily and never keep it overnight.  An expertly fried fresh Hor Fun is smokey with chewy charred bits at the edges and soft and slurpy at the same time.  The sauce is pretty good and they do have fresh and good quality seafood although they do lack the more traditional pork tripe. ", "The other item which was recommended to me was the fried chicken.  It is supposed to be Har Cheong Kai, but I think it tastes better if you don't call it that.  It's a really tasty fried chicken but a mediocre Har Cheong Kai.

The yellow-green curry chicken is known as \"Ayam Pangang\" at this stall which just means \"Grilled Chicken\"  They don't call it Korma here, but it certainly has a taste and an appearance that hints of Chicken Korma.

Red meat consist of slow twitch muscle fibres while white meat consist of fast twitch muscles.  Slow twitch muscles are used for slower, sustained activity such as walking while fast twitch muscles are good for quick but short lived bursts of activity.  So, chicken breast is typically white meat because a chicken doesn't really fly, it uses its breast muscles to quickly flap its wings when it is excited.   The legs contain more slow twitch muscles since it is always walking around.  That explains the difference in tastes of the two parts of the chicken.  But since ducks actually fly (most migrate seasonally), the breast meat contains more slow twitch muscles so that they can have sustained muscle activity while they fly for long distances.  Which is why duck breast tastes more like red meat. Yes or no?", "The Braised Duck here is quite good. The breast is nice and tender and because it is sliced thin and wide, the texture is very different from your usual braised duck.

I am sure you all agree that it is increasingly difficult to find special places with character and charm to dine in in Singapore where there is a constant push to renovate and renew. When I look back, most of the places that my wife and I used to Pak Tor (go dating) are now only a memory or a picture in the Singapore archives. So our visit to the Stewards Riverboat floating restaurant came as a real delight, especially for the kids.", "For those who remember, this boat was first built in 1991 and originally housed the A&W restaurant at Sentosa. Most people around my generation who where kids when A&W were still around can probably still remember the familiar jingle \"A&W, A&W, A&W..... is where, root bear floaters, burgers sizzlers, coney dogs, french fries, ice cream toooooo\"", "Since then, the Riverboat was taken over by Santa Fe Tex Mex Grill for 6 years while it was still in Sentosa. With the new developments at Sentosa, the Riverboat has been relocated to the brand spanking new Marina South Pier and has undergone a makeover as well.", "The Santa Fe Tex Mex Grill still occupies the main deck (shechem), while the upper deck (bethel) is a function hall that can be used to cater to functions like weddings and birthday parties. On Sundays there is even a Church service held there. The bridge deck (hebron) is an Al Fresco eatery that will house a brand new restaurant to be launched later next month. Right on the very top is the Captain's Wheelhouse which has a table for two set up for those very special occasions. I was told that 5 marriage proposals have been carried out there and they have a 100% success rate! They also have a private Jacuzzi up here which they even use to conduct Water Baptisms!", "Santa Fe restaurant serves Tex Mex style food which is all about beans, cheese, jalapeno peppers, tacos, nachos, fajitas..... Try saying that with a Mexican accent and you will invariably start sounding like Speedy Gonzales! \"Ariba, Ariba, Andale, eh hah!\"", "The babyback ribs here are pretty good. The ribs have been smoked for a long time such that the meat separates from the bone easily and it's tender and smoky flavoured. The BBQ sauce is pretty good, though I would have liked it a bit sweeter (I usually go for the honey ribs at Tony Romas). ", "The Chicken Chimichangas are something new for me.

According to the legend, this Mexican Lady accidentally dropped a Burrito into the deep fryer and she let out a curse word which she quickly edited to \"Chimichanga\". Hmmm, I wonder if that is how deep fried Poh Piah started as well?", "Another dish I would recommend is the Turkey Quesadillas. Can't really go wrong with smoked Turkey breast, cheese, sauteed onions and BBQ sauce. The Turkey breast gave it a very savoury taste which can be quite addictive.

The Riverboat represents more then just a business, he believes that it is a place where family bonds can be renewed, friendships can be deepened and faith can be found.

I had to repeat the word sausage three times before the lady got the message and blurted out \"Orh, you want Haw Lok (hot dog) izzit?\"", "It was while I was studying in Australia that I realise that most butcher shops actually made their own of sausages. As Singaporeans become accustomed to having more authentic western cuisine, specialised butchers like Swiss Butchery and Espirito Santo began to appear to cater to the growing number of well travelled Singaporeans as well as expats. These butchers offer specialty cuts of meats, cold cuts and sausages which are difficult to find in your friendly neighbourhood NTUC or even Cold Storage.", "The latest specialty butchery tapping into this growing market is Butcher House located in River Valley Road. Opened only 4 months ago by Mr Y L Chia and his team of butchers, this is probably the first \"Western\" Butcher that is wholly Singaporean own with their own sausage production facility.", "Mr Chia is just your regular Teochew Ah Hia (like me) who has never even been to Germany or Europe for that matter. But when you taste his sausages, you'd think that there must be some German blood in him. He was making sausages for the Swiss Butchery for 10 years before he decided to start his own factory to produce his own blend of sausages. You'd be amazed at the variety that he churns out. From Bockwurst to Spicy Italian to Chicken and Cheese, the list is exhaustive.", "The Chicken and Cheese is the best I've ever tasted. He uses only chicken thigh meat and does not add any flour or starch fillers. The big difference in the taste comes from the use of quality Gouda cheese. At $24 per kilo, the chicken and cheese is great value and guaranteed to give you that umami rush. ", "Besides sausages, he also makes his own variety of cold cuts. I really enjoyed the beef pastrami and mushroom lyoner. They also produce whole legs of honey baked ham. Mr Chia explains that hams are now injected with brine rather then soaked, which drastically reduces the marination time.", "The service at the butchery is excellent. Because they make all the sausages themselves, the butchers are more than happy to present some freshly grilled sausage samples. Beware though, you are not likely to walk away empty handed once you have tasted the sausages! You must get them to grill some smoked duck breast for you to sample as well. It was very tender and smoky and really good for a tasty warm sandwich. ", "The butchery also stocks very good cuts of Beef like Wagyu grade 7 Ribeye ($280/kg), NZ rack of Lamb and Kurobuta Pork. If you like to prepare Korean BBQs, they have nice Beef Short Ribs (Aust) here for $32/kg. Those planning a BBQ might like to do something fancy and pick up a selection of marinated skewered meats and specialty sausages rather then settle for the usual chicken wings and chicken franks.", "Mr Chia was kind enough to showed us around his brand new sausage factory in Macpherson and gave us an overview of the sausage making process. Basically, the meats and spices are finely chopped up in a special machine and then pushed into the sausage casing which is usually derived from sheep intestines. Interestingly, this is the most expensive part of the sausage but most of the time you will not even think about it when you are savouring your sausage. The outer casing is made by stripping away all the fleshy intimal layers so as to leave only with the tough, transparent outer layer (Serosa). This is the same stuff they use to make strings for your squash and tennis racquets. (Which is why they are called Gut) After the filling process, the sausages are either cooked in 70 degree water or put into the smoker (pic above). Sausages prepared this way is deemed cooked and ready to be eaten!", "I really admire the entrepreneurial spirit in Mr Chia. He grew up in Hougang \"6 pieces of rock\" (lit Teochew translation meaning \"six milestones\") helping his Uncle sell meat in the wet market before joining Swiss Butchery as an apprentice sausage maker and working his way up to become the Top Dog (head sausage maker). When you talk to him you would hardly consider him to be \"Ang Mo Pai\" (westernised), but his sausages are so authentic that he has even earned the stamp of approval from local German Chefs. If you love sausages, you must make a trip down to the Butcher House to try their wide selection.

This reminds me of the fried egg dish that you always get on your cold dish in a 8 course Chinese Dinner. Its Shark's Fin fried with egg, crab meat and Tau Gay (Bean Sprouts) and served with fresh crisp lettuce. It is very good but not a die die must try. At $30, you'd have to try it at least once and decide if you are willing to pay for it the next time. ", "The Fried Fish Slices with Bittergourd is very nice and one of the best I have tasted. They use Loi Her (Snake Head) which is a fresh water fish. You can taste the bitterness of the bittergourd which gives it a bit of bite and when combined with the chilli and black beans.. fantastic. This dish is definitely one I am coming back for. $10 ", "The Black Pepper Beef is a misnomer. Its not just black pepper, the super tender slices of beef are fried in garlic, chillies, capsicums and spring onions. One of the better ones I have tasted. $10 ", "Their version of Salted Fish Mince Pork is unique in that they added waterchestnut to give it a sweet and crunchy twist. I love it. Mince pork a bit thin and would be great if it were double the thickness. They use threadfin salted fish from Malaysia which gives it a fantastic salted fish flavour. $6 ", "The Har Cheong Kai is very good but not the best around. It would have been much better if they used fresh chicken. Taste wise, it is very good, and you know that they marinade it for a long time by the amount of red colouring that has seeped into the flesh. Good, but I have had better Har Cheong Kai from Hong Kong Street Fish Head Steamboat over at Alexander Village. $8 ", "Mr Soon is the original Chef. Although he is Hokkien, the food is not really Hokkien cuisine, but a mix of whatever is great from the other dialect groups. In other words. Singapore cuisine! They have been in business for over 40 years but moved here only 14 years ago.", "One of those places that you simply want to go back again and again. All the dishes we tried were very good, some were exceptional. If we had ordered a sweet and sour pork in place of the fried sharks fin, we would have paid less then $50 for five really nice dishes. I was fortunate to go on a long weekend when you don't have to queue outside for a table. If you are going, do get there either before 6pm or after 9pm or risk a long queue.", "Other dishes I was recommended: Lotus root soup, fried sweet potato leaves.

Large King Prawns are deep fried in batter and then coated with this creamy sweet corn sauce that hints of condensed milk and curry leaves. This is really very good and definitely a must try. One may complain that the prawns are not live prawns but for me the only way to eat live prawns is plainly steamed. I don't mind unlive prawns done this way. $20 ", "The Mongolian Pork Ribs were very good. The pork ribs were large, beyond bite sized pieces, but were still very tender and did not hint of the use of bicarb. The sauce was grainy and rough, more tangy and savoury then sweet. It was good, but next time I will try ordering their Jing Dou Pai Kuat. $10", "This is another really good dish. Homemade Tofu (made from soy milk and eggs) is first deep fried and then drown in a mince pork and long bean gravy.

Over the years, the Loos have been constantly supplying the Lims with Dark Soy Sauce, preserving the same recipe as before.\u00a0 ", "Now we come to the third family, the Ohs.\u00a0 The Ohs are a 3rd generation master baker of Pau Skin.\u00a0 When you eat Kong Bak Pau at Westlake, you know that there is something very special about the Pau Skin that you can't find anywhere else.\u00a0 That is because the Ohs have been supplying Westlake with the same Pau Skin that is made with the traditional method of adding lye water (kee zhui) and using yeast instead of baking powder as the raising agent.\u00a0 Lye water makes the dough alkaline and when flour is subjected to alkaline conditions, it becomes more springy.\u00a0 Incidentally,\u00a0 lye water is the ingredient that differentiates Chinese noodles from Italian pasta.\u00a0 Whereas Chinese noodles are springy because of the addition of lye water, Italian pasta tends to be more toothy.\u00a0 Nowadays, not many bakers use lye water in their recipes, but they continue to make the Pau Skin the same way just for Westlake.", "Now when it comes to braised pork, there are many methods of cooking it.\u00a0 The easiest way is simply to simmer the pork belly in braising sauce.\u00a0\u00a0 However,\u00a0 if you want to make an exceptional braised pork that has that soft fat layer and a skin which is tender, then it needs to go through several steps.\u00a0 At Westlake, the pork is first boiled, then dipped in braising sauce before being deep fried, after which it is cut into bun sized slices before being marinated in braising sauce.\u00a0 Then when you order the braised pork, one serving portion is freshly steamed and served with the buns.\u00a0 The whole process of making the braised pork takes 6 to 8 hours! ", "It was Rockett Girl who first told me about her amazing lunch at Westlake restaurant.\u00a0 All the while, I have only known of the Westlake Kong Bak Pau which is sold at the Kiosks in Shopping Centres, but it never occurred to me that there was a restaurant!\u00a0 Westlake is by the way, no where near Westlake.\u00a0 It is in Queen's Road, just stone's throw away from St Margaret's Secondary School. The HDB flats that the restaurant has been for the last 37 years is unique to say the least.\u00a0 It has a open carpark which is located at the basement of the block of flats and if you have never been there before, it is worth the trip just to park your car there and have a look around and soak in the nostalgia. ", "Aside from Kong Bak Pau, Westlake has several other signature dishes which you must try.\u00a0 One of this is the Sze Chuan Hot and Sour Soup.\u00a0 Now, you might wonder why Sze Chuan dishes feature at Westlake.\u00a0 Well, it so happens that both Mr Lim and his wife did their tertiary education at Chengdu before the war and that was where they grew to like Sze Chuan cuisine.\u00a0 The menu of Westlake really just reflects the kind of food Mr Lim loves.\u00a0 ", "When you visit Westlake, be sure to order the Hot and Sour Soup.\u00a0 It's the best that I have tasted in recent memory.\u00a0 The balance of Hot and Sour is just right.\u00a0 The \"Hot\" is just enough to give you a kick, not enough to make you sweat.\u00a0 The \"Sour\" is just enough to give you a buzz, but not enough to make you wince and the generous dash of sesame oil gives it a wonderful fragrance!\u00a0 ", "The other must try dish is the Kong Bao Ji Ding.\u00a0 This is one of the best I have come across.\u00a0 Again the flavours are excellently balanced and the smokey chilli flavour comes from dried chillies that were specially selected for this particular dish.\u00a0 One of the key ingredients in Kong Bao Ji Ding is the fragrant vinegar and which gives it aroma as well as a nice tang.\u00a0 ", "Long before Shanghainese restaurants and Japanese gyoza hit Singapore, Westlake was already serving up Guo Tie, which is yet another dish which Mr Lim picked up in his travels.\u00a0 The skin is amazingly crisp and I was told that even the Japanese came to the restaurant to buy the raw ones to bring home to Japan!

Then there are the tomatoes.\u00a0 Yes, you need Italian tomatoes, ", " if possible.\u00a0 But fortunately, I wasn't the only one crazy about the perfect pizza.\u00a0 My kaki Damien, whom you all are familiar with as one of the walking directories on Singapore food was my accomplice.\u00a0 He even went to the extent of working for a Pizza Master in Naples for 3 months to learn how to make the perfect Neapolitan pizza!\u00a0 (Naples was previously known as Neapolis - hence the name Neapolitan)", "Along the way, my appreciation for Pizza underwent a transformation.\u00a0 In the past, it was all about having a great topping.\u00a0 Now, the be all and end all of any pizza is the pizza base.\u00a0 Anyone can put Parma ham and rocket leaves on top of a pizza, but not everyone can get the crust right.\u00a0 Can you imagine the best slice of Otoro on top of mediocre Sushi Rice?", "When I did my first Pizza Party for the kakis, most of them requested for the thin and crispy crust.\u00a0 But once they tasted the Neo-Neapolitan style crust, all of them were won over.\u00a0 Thin and crispy is just too one dimensional.\u00a0 The Neapolitan crust has a wonderful ", " (The outer rim of dough) that is puffy and has a crunchy snap to it while the rest of the base is tender with a nice chewy bite. In between the Cornicione and the middle part of the base is the transformation zone which ideally should still be a little moist.\u00a0 The only way to achieve this is if you have a wet dough and a really hot oven which can reach 450 degrees celcius. ", "Aside from the texture, a really good pizza crust must have a complexity of aroma that can only be achieved through the proper maturation of the dough.\u00a0 If you eat any pizza base and feel that the taste lacks that savoury flavour that coats the whole of the mouth, it just means that the dough was probably made a few hours before it was cooked.\u00a0 The best pizzerias in the world have got mature dough which are older than most of us.\u00a0 Just like the legend of the Braised Duck Lor (braising sauce) which ever gets decanted but just gets new ingredients added to the pot everyday, really good pizzerias always leave a batch of old dough which is added to a batch of new dough in order to preserve the lineage of the yeast.\u00a0 ", "Just about the most important piece of equipment in pizza making is the oven itself.\u00a0 The rest of the pizza, from the base to the sauce can actually be done quite well at home.\u00a0 But without the wood fired oven which can go up to 450 degrees C, you are never going to get close to an authentic Neopolitan Pizza.\u00a0 At home I have a standard oven that only goes up to 250 degrees C, so my pizza takes almost 10 minutes to bake.\u00a0 So although I get a nice crispy crust, it becomes a tad dry. To overcome that, I have to use a very wet dough that is very difficult to handle.\u00a0 My ", " which has a stone base and can go up to 350 degrees C gets me closer to the target but still not quite there.", "So whenever I visit a pizzeria in Singapore, my first task is to have a look at the pizza oven.\u00a0 Lately there have been many new wood fired pizza joints that have opened which is great.\u00a0 But I have noticed that most of them only go half way and compromise by having gas burners in the oven.\u00a0 I suspect that this is a cost saving measure because you really need a steady stream of pizza orders to keep the wood fire going all day.\u00a0 So most restaurants compromise and use gas during the off peak period.\u00a0 A real pizza oven actually takes up to ten days to get to the right temperature, so turning the gas on and off is not a great idea if you are serious about good pizzas. ", "I have been going around tasting pizzas from some of the pizzerias that people have recommended but so far they have been disappointing which is why you haven't read any pizza posts this year. I guess my gold standard for pizza has moved up a few notches since I started on my pizza quest so I am looking for a lot more.\u00a0 Most of these places give the outward appearance that they are serving authentic Neopolitan Pizza but come up short by taking shortcuts.\u00a0 ", "When I heard that my friend Gerri from ", " was planning to open a wood fired pizza joint, I was excited.\u00a0 I have known Gerri and Mauro for a while now and I know these guys are passionate about delivering authentic Italian food.\u00a0 So on my first visit to Sole Pomodoro, my first question for Gerri was whether his oven was a real Italian wood fired oven, to which the answer was \"Of course!\" The next question I posed him was what kind of Buffalo Mozzarella he uses to which he said that their Buffalo Mozzarella is airflown three times a week from a small cheese maker in Campania.\u00a0 When I heard that, I knew that they are serious about the Pizza.", "You see I have been trying to get my hands on some real Buffalo Mozzarella for a long time.\u00a0 It is not cheap and the one place in the world that makes Buffalo Mozzarella for the best Neopolitan Pizzas in Naples come from the volcanic region of Campania.\u00a0 Most the Buffalo Mozarella that I can get my hands on in Singapore come individually packed.\u00a0 There are many distributors of these individually packed Mozzarella cheese in Singapore and you can get them at supermarkets and specialty grocery stores, but there is no way I can get my hands on the fresh Mozzarella that Sole Pomodoro imports direct from Italy!", "The pizzas at Sole Pomodoro are the best ones I have eaten in Singapore so far.\u00a0 The crust has a complexity of flavour, the Cornicione is crisp with an airy crumb and the middle of the pizza is chewy.\u00a0 The tomato sauce is fresh with a bit of zing to it and if you are ordering the Buffalo Margharita, the cheese is wonderfully creamy.\u00a0 My only comment was that Sole prefers to add the Buffalo Mozarella after the pizza is baked because they prefer not to drain the cheese first.\u00a0 As far as I know, this is not how they do it in Naples.\u00a0 But the creamy and cold Mozzarella on pipping hot pizza does have its own appeal.\u00a0 ", "The other flavour which I would recommend for those who  want a little more smokey savoury salty flavour in the pizza is the home  smoked bacon with cherry tomato and ricotta cheese pizza.\u00a0 Their home  smoked bacon is in a class of its own and has that chewy texture like  how all cured meats should have.\u00a0 ", "I wasn't enthusiastic about all their pizzas.\u00a0 One which I wouldn't order again is the Sole Pomodoro which is a new topping specially for the restaurant.\u00a0 I felt the potatoes were nice but overall the pizza lacked enough savoury flavour and was dominated by too much tang coming from the sundried tomatoes.

The combination of the home cured beef and generous slices of Fontina cheese is excellent.\u00a0 ", "I finally managed to find a Neopolitan style pizza which I can rave about!\u00a0 If you have always preferred the thin and crispy pizza, I hope this one will change your mind.\u00a0 Until I eventually get to go to Naples to eat pizza at ", ", this will have to do.

(Its the same here at Kwong Woh Hing)\u00a0 In the Singapore market, there is  usually a Premium/Superior Grade and a Standard Grade.\u00a0 The difference  really depends on each manufacturer.\u00a0 But in general, a Premium Grade soy  sauce means that there is less additives added to the resulting liquor at the  end of the fermentation process.", "The purest form of Soy Sauce that you can get is the resulting liquor after the end of the fermentation process.\u00a0 This liquor contains all the natural products of fermentation.\u00a0 Just like Extra Virgin Olive Oil, this can be called Extra Virgin Soy Sauce and is the best grade Soy Sauce.\u00a0 From here brine and other additives are added to make commercial grade Soy Sauce.\u00a0 They also add more brine to the left over beans and go for a second fermentation which results in yet another (lesser) grade of Soy Sauce.", "\u00a0 ", "The period of fermentation is very important as wine  connoisseurs will also tell you.\u00a0 The longer the fermentation, the  better the resulting product.\u00a0 Most \"Naturally Brewed\" Soy Sauce would  be fermented for a couple of months.\u00a0 Nowadays, the period of fermentation can  also be shortened with the use of chemical boosters. I am glad that the  owners of Kwong Woh Hin have kept to traditional ways and are still  fermenting their Soy Sauce in urns (Some dating back to 1943) under the  Singapore sun for a whole year.\u00a0 They tell me that if they stretched  it to three years, the Soy Sauce is even better, but they can't do it  due to land scarcity. I keep stressing \"Singapore sun\" because you do need a temperature of between 30 to 35 degrees for fermentation to take place.\u00a0 So in temperate countries the urns have to be kept warm artificially.\u00a0 However, in tropical Singapore, the soy beans can be left to ferment under the heat of natural sunlight all year round.", "\u00a0", "The grade of the Soy Sauce is also determined by what happens in the  final processing.\u00a0 The premium grade soy sauce which Kwong Woh Hing  bottles is the first pressed liquor that is filtered with some rock sugar and preservative added to stop  the fermentation process.\u00a0 This artisanal Soy Sauce is available only at their factory.

Compared it to the other commercial Soy Sauces that I picked up from the supermarket, the difference is quite distinct.\u00a0 The cheap Soy Sauce still tastes good, but the taste is more one dimensional, since you are essentially tasting glutamate (MSG) and it also lacks a complex aroma.\u00a0 Terry tasted the premium light Soy Sauce and agreed that it is indeed better than the one he gets from Malaysia.\u00a0 I haven't done a comparison of the Dark Soy Sauce yet, but I can tell you that it went really well with the Chicken Rice that my mother-in-law made. ", "To understand why a naturally brewed Soy Sauce tastes better than a chemically enhanced one, we need understand a little bit about soya beans and the process of fermentation.\u00a0 Soy Beans are an exceptional source of proteins.\u00a0 They are one of the very few plants products that contain all the essential amino acids that our bodies cannot manufacture.\u00a0 That is the reason why Tofu and other soya bean products have been used for thousands of years in China as an alternative to meat. ", "Now, our bodies are wired to know what to eat, even though we may not realize it.\u00a0 We have receptors on our tongues to detect amino acids of which glutamate is one.\u00a0\u00a0 So physiologically speaking, the reason we love MSG so much is because our bodies need protein and our tongues have receptors detect these glutamates.\u00a0 But there are many other amino acids which our palate can detect and this is now at the the forefront of scientific research.\u00a0 The concept of ", " has been proposed by Japanese scientists as yet another flavour enhancer that gives tasty food that \"heartiness\" or full mouth feel.\u00a0 In order to experience Kokumi, the palate needs to detect another set of amino acids, viz histadine and glutathione.\u00a0 Histadine is yet another essential amino acid that the body cannot manufacture but, as you guessed it, it is present in soya beans.\u00a0 So a naturally fermented product would contain not only glutamates but a whole array of amino acids as compared to a product boosted with just glutamate.\u00a0 One is like listening to an orchestra while this other is a solo violin recital.\u00a0 In addition, during the process of fermentation, the ", " mold also breaks down the carbohydrates found in the wheat flour into sugars and then into alcohol.\u00a0 These aromatic esters are easily detected when you smell a naturally brewed soy sauce which might not be as distinct in one that is made through accelerated chemical hydrolysis.

Of course he was mum about what spices he uses. At least now I know why his BCM tastes a little different from the rest.  I like the \"mee pok\" he uses here as it is the thin and flat type.  It has a very good bite and has that excellent eggy flavour. ", "Those who like braised pork ribs should really give his pork ribs a go.

For $10 a big bowl, it is well worth the money.  It is chock a block full of Fish Maw, minced pork, sliced pork, black fungas and liver.  And the soup is so full of pork protein precipitates that even if you feel that you need an extreme umami boost (like having spent a week eating hospital food), I can guarantee that a bowl of this soup will still be \"Too Much\" for you!

Well, he didn't really distill the wine himself but he adds his blend of herbs and spices and lets it all soak for a week before using just a few drops of it to spike the dish. I had a whiff of it and take it from me, a few drops is all that is needed!", "The Kailan were tender and the sauce was really good.

I suggested that the pumpkin paste would be even more shiok if he would roast the pumpkin instead of steaming it.
