In this case, I was excited by the mere-presence of the word, <em>beef cheeks</em>.</p><p>What part, you asked again?</p><p>Beef cheeks. Pardon me, but I have never eaten somebody\u2019s cheek before.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1954.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Red wine braised beef cheeks</strong>, carrots, mushrooms and parsley potatoes. I realised I couldn\u2019t really tell the difference between the different parts of the cow, but did it really mattered? The braised beef cheeks were tenderly-done, and there was the potatoes which were a-part-of-it.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1951.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>I had to agree that braised beef tasted better than lamb shank, or maybe I haven\u2019t tried one that is worthy, yet.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1948.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>If the beef cheek were tenderly-done, then the <strong>Pan seared onglet beef</strong> was done exactly the way I love it! And just exactly what was Onglet, I know it\u2019s a prime cut of beef, but past that I\u2019m beyond caring. Don\u2019t talk to me about the different grade, the marbling of the meat, there ain\u2019t no need to discuss the cooking technique, I-just-liked-this!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1955.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>With a tinge of pink, the medium-rare meat was per-fect! And I love the confit shallots which spreaded over the top of the beef, like the sky covered over the land. The presence of the French fries were puzzling, I decided I was going to ignore its guest appearance on the plate and focused on the beef instead.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1959.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The <strong>lemon tart</strong> was fabulous \u2013 how can something so simple. be so, absolutely wonderful. The texture of the lemon curd was done just right, and paired with the subtle ice cream with a hint of lavender-honey,                                              I\u2019m a happy boy.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1967.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>I had a quickie with the <strong>Cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e</strong>; I took the first taste, stunned for a moment, and took my second. This continued until I finished the whole dessert. Beneath the nicely-touched caramelised sugar, was the smoothest yet firm, custard, infused with vanilla beans.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/au%20petit%20salut/DSC_1978.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Till we meet again, my love</p><p>* * *</p><p><strong>Total bill</strong> was $70 for two set lunches.

But then again, I\u2019m biased against char siew sou.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/asia%20grand/DSC_2337.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The fragrant <strong>glutinous rice</strong> ($4.50) enveloped within the leaf; the salted egg yoke bursting through your tastebud with it\u2019s strong and distinct taste, the little bites of chicken shreds, a pity the Chinese sausages were missing here. Almost perfect.</p><p>Pan-fried <strong>carrot cake</strong> ($3.50) used to be a favourite of mine, but after trying several half-hearted versions, I\u2019m leaning towards some of the better <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2009/06/19/hai-tien-lo-the-37th-level-view/\">steamed</a> ones that I had. Packed the carrot cake full with relish, lots of them. Then lightly-seared it until golden brown, leaving a crispy surface with soft relish beneath it. Sounds easy? Do one for me.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/asia%20grand/DSC_2347.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Actually I\u2019m undecided if I will come back to Asia Grand for dim sum again.

While the <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/07/best-french-restaurants-food-singapore/\">French tea salon</a> at Mandarin Gallery has a great location, it is much smaller than Penhas Road.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019d definitely recommend going to Penhas Road instead of Mandarin Gallery as the latter does not allow reservations and there is always a queue during peak hours.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20017\" title=\"Anoinette Cake\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Anoinette-Cake.jpg\" alt=\"Anoinette Cake\" width=\"550\" height=\"851\"></p><p>If I could only choose one cake, I would definitely go for Antoinette ($9).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even up till now, I could still remember my first encounter with it. The Chocolate Earl Grey cake caught my attention with its glossy surface; I could almost hear it calling out to me.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I took a fork and tapped it lightly, unsure of how soft or hard it would be. My fork easily went through the milk chocolate mousse infused with earl grey tea cake. The only words to describe it? Luxurious, chic, and heavenly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will go so far as to say that my hunt for the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/09/top-10-cakes-singapore\">best cake in Singapore</a></span> ended with the Antoinette chocolate earl grey cake. It is rock-my-socks-off good!</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19982\" title=\"Saint HonoreL\u2019amour\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Saint-HonoreL%E2%80%99amour.jpg\" alt=\"Saint HonoreL\u2019amour\" width=\"550\" height=\"826\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the Antoinette cake was divine, the Saint Honore L\u2019amour ($8.5) \u2013 made up of choux pastry, rose petal cream, and strawberry compote on an almond tart \u2013 would be the perfect representative of love and romance.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19983\" title=\"Choclicieux\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Choclicieux.jpg\" alt=\"Choclicieux\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another interesting option is the Chocolieux ($9.5). When the staff brought it to our table, we thought that we were having ice cream as it was molded into the shape like a magnum. How wrong we were.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was actually a dessert (I find it difficult to call it a cake) made up of dark chocolate cream, hazelnut nougatine, dark chocolate biscuit and almond chocolate.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19984\" title=\"Cafe Caramel\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Cafe-Caramel.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe Caramel\" width=\"550\" height=\"764\"></p><p>On my fourth (or fifth time) there, we tried Strawberry Shortcake ($8) and Caf\u00e9 Caramel ($8).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Caf\u00e9 Caramel ($8) \u2013 an almond tart composing of caramel a la fleur de sel, genoise cafe, and coffee mousse \u2013 was well executed, but nothing special.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be honest, I was a little unsure about the Strawberry Shortcake as I didn\u2019t have a good impression of the one Chef Pang made at <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/12/canele-patisserie-chocolaterie-desserts-singapore/\">Canele Patisserie</a>. It was actually not too bad. I\u2019d include it in my list of <em>best Strawberry Cakes in Singapore</em>, but it is not my favourite.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20016\" title=\"Caramel with fleur de sel\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Caramel-with-fleur-de-sel.jpg\" alt=\"Caramel with fleur de sel\" width=\"550\" height=\"359\"></p><p>I marvelled at the Religiuese of Caramel with fleur de sel ($8) when it arrived at the table. It was so beautiful! I found it to be a little too sweet, so you might want to order this to share.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among the cakes at Antoinette Patisserie, I also had the Exotique ($8.5) \u2013 mousse exotique with coconut cremeux and poached pineapple; Pudding Maple ($6.5) \u2013 maple flan with caramel, in a cup; and Strawberry Baba ($8) \u2013 baba pastry, citrus rum syrup and vanilla cr\u00e8me Chantilly.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20019\" title=\"Chicken burger\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Chicken-burger.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken burger\" width=\"550\" height=\"826\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you prefer savoury food, you must try their Chicken Burger, which is one of the <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/08/best-burger-restaurants-places-singapore/\">better burgers</a> that I\u2019ve had. Besides desserts, Antoinette also has All Day breakfast ($9 \u2013 20) such as Eggs Florentine, Baked Omelette; French Toast ($10.5), Crepes ($15 \u2013 20) and Pancakes ($10 \u2013 15); entrees ($10.5 \u2013 23) like Salad and Foie Gras Terrine; and main courses ($16.5 \u2013 38) which include options like Bouef Bourguignon and Gnocchi Carbonara.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20018\" title=\"Antoinette Penhas Road\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Antoinette-Penhas-Road.jpg\" alt=\"Antoinette Penhas Road\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Antoinette</strong>, without a doubt, is my <em>favourite patisserie in Singapore</em>. But then again, I am a big fan of Chef Pang, so I\u2019m definitely biased. Don\u2019t take my word for it, go there and try the cakes for yourself. Service can be very patchy depending on the time you are there, but really, who cares so long we can have good cakes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The French patisserie is a great place for a quiet <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/08/singapore-afternoon-high-tea-buffet/\">afternoon high tea</a>. If I lived near the Lavender area, I could imagine myself dropping by the Parisian tea salon every other day.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Singapore Food Blog Review</span><br>\nAntoinette Patisserie Tea Salon<br>\n30 Penhas Road<br>\nTel: +65 6293 3121</p><p>333A Orchard Road<br>\n#02-33/34 Mandarin Gallery<br>\nTel: +65 6836 9527</p><p>33 Erskine Road<br>\n#01-02/03 Scarlet Hotel</p><p>For more recommendations, read my list of <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/06/best-dessert-places-singapore/\">best dessert places in Singapore</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/06/07/best-dessert-places-singapore/\" id=\"icon-1\" class=\"list-icon\">icon-1</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/12/best-strawberry-shortcakes-singapore/\" id=\"icon-9\" class=\"list-icon\">icon-9</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/12/antoinette-parisian-patisserie-tea-salon/", "location": "33 Erskine Road, Singapore 069333", "latitude": 1.2807456},

Alas, that\u2019s not quite the raison d\u2019\u00eatre.</p><p>The explication for our extravagant &amp; exaggerated behavior is because \u2026 \u2026</p><p>We had a <strong>50% discount coupon</strong> from OCBC. Yes, you didn\u2019t see wrongly, half price for a la carte items during lunch &amp; dinner, up to a table of 4 persons. Dinner was with the <em>Yebbers</em>. So everything we look at, we can only see half the price, and of course this makes it affordable and worry-free to order whatever we like. So we ordered mostly the more expensive dishes : )</p><p><a title=\"img_4951.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4951.jpg\"><img style=\"width: 492px; height: 364px;\" src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4951.jpg\" alt=\"img_4951.jpg\" width=\"519\" height=\"402\"></a><br>\nThe exterior of the restaurant</p><p><span id=\"more-229\"></span></p><p><a title=\"img_4955.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4955.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4955.jpg\" alt=\"img_4955.jpg\" width=\"495\" height=\"363\"></a><br>\nAl Dente Pronto</p><p><a title=\"img_4959.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4959.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4959.jpg\" alt=\"img_4959.jpg\" width=\"501\" height=\"345\"></a><br>\nTomato Basil Bruschetta ($5.0)</p><p>We kick start our dinner with the <strong>Tomato Basil Bruschettra</strong>. Diced Tomato, Garlic, Basil, Oregano and olive oil formulate the starter. We were uncertain whether they gave 8 pieces because there are four of us, or it always come in 8 pieces irregardless of the number of people dining. All the same, we felt the starter could do with more tomato, mayb its because of the rising price in agriculture products in China. Think think. First bite into the Bruschettra was crispy and the garlic taste was done just nice. At $2.50 after discount, it was a real good deal.</p><p><a title=\"img_4961.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4961.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4961.jpg\" alt=\"img_4961.jpg\" width=\"506\" height=\"382\"></a><br>\nGrilled Portobello mushrooms ($12.0)</p><p>Our second starter was the <strong>Grilled Portobello Mushrooms</strong>. Served with rocket salad and diced tomatos. The presentation of the dish was done beautifully, but sadly to sad i felt that at $12 it was definitely not worth the price. Even at half price i won\u2019t order it again.</p><p><a title=\"img_4964.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4964.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4964.jpg\" alt=\"img_4964.jpg\" width=\"509\" height=\"380\"></a><br>\nChar-Grilled Sirloin Steak ($20.0)</p><p>Finishing our starter, the waiter note our cue to start our Main course for the night. Our first main was the <strong>Char-Grilled Sirloin Steak</strong>. We requested for medium-rare, but then when the steak was served it was a tad tougher than what we expected from a medium-rare steak. I guess they sort of make it into medium-well instead. Well, its Italiano and not a steakhouse after all. Nevertheless, i felt that the steak was pretty decent, and at half the price of $10, it was value. Oh yes, we liked the potato that came with it, pretty much reminds us of our childhood.</p><p><a title=\"img_4967.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4967.jpg\"><img style=\"width: 358px; height: 466px;\" src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4967.jpg\" alt=\"img_4967.jpg\" width=\"379\" height=\"497\"></a><br>\nPan-Seared Butterfish ($20.0)</p><p>Served with potatos, saut\u00e8ed vegetables and topped with a lemon dill butter glace. Al Dente Pronto actually only have three main course available, the other one being <strong>roasted corn fed chicken</strong> which we didn\u2019t order. I suppose the raison d\u2019\u00eatre was because the mains are not really their area of specialty. Al Dente Pronto\u2019s extensive variety of Italian Pizzas and Pastas are where they fare better.</p><p><a title=\"img_4970.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4970.jpg\"><img style=\"width: 358px; height: 444px;\" src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4970.jpg\" alt=\"img_4970.jpg\" width=\"354\" height=\"425\"></a><br>\nSmoked Chicken Pizza ($17.0)</p><p>This is the star of tonight\u2019s show. <strong>The Smoked Chicken Pizza</strong> might not look very special, but then they are undeniably scrumptious, with large chunks of chicken meat beneath the cheesy cheese. Pizza comes flat, thin and crispy.</p><p><a title=\"img_4973.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4973.jpg\"><img style=\"width: 361px; height: 448px;\" src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4973.jpg\" alt=\"img_4973.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"448\"></a><br>\nArragosta Pasta ($20.0)</p><p>Spaghetti with Lobster meat, zucchini and mushrooms, with tomato stew or garlic sauce. We opted for garlic sauce with the belief that garlic can compliment Lobster meat better. And i thought the <strong>Arragosta Pasta</strong> comes out quite well, mayb except for the fact that it was slightly too dry. I like the lobster meat, which was quite generously furnish on top of the pasta. And i think zucchini (cucumbers) are rather a rare sight in pasta cuisine. Nonetheless, at half price of $10 i think its quite good for money, we are talking about Lobster meat after all.</p><p><a title=\"img_4982.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4982.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4982.jpg\" alt=\"img_4982.jpg\" width=\"361\" height=\"444\"></a><br>\nTiramisu ($9.0)</p><p>To end off the meal, we had <strong>Tiramisu</strong> as our first dessert. Layers of mascarpone with sponge fingers soaked in coffee and brandy, served with bittersweet chocolate powder The presentation was all right, but the cake was too tough, we had to literally dig inside it to get the tiramisu out.</p><p><a title=\"img_4983.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4983.jpg\"><img style=\"width: 490px; height: 357px;\" src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4983.jpg\" alt=\"img_4983.jpg\" width=\"527\" height=\"380\"></a><br>\nMacadamia Scented Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e8e ($8.0)</p><p>Caramelized custard, infused with Macadamia nut oil served with strawberries on the <strong>Macadamia Scented Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e8e</strong>.</p><p><a title=\"img_4984.jpg\" href=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4984.jpg\"><img style=\"width: 329px; height: 438px;\" src=\"http://ladyironchef.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/img_4984.jpg\" alt=\"img_4984.jpg\" width=\"256\" height=\"416\"></a></p><p>Total Bill was $122.50 before discount, the amount that we paid for 4 person was $71.20 after discount. The calulations are kind of complicated because the 50% discount does not includes GST and service charge, so they had to count the total price without including them, half the price, and add on the 17% additional charges. Poof! Its comes down to around $18 for per person which i think is reasonably cheap.</p><p>All in all, Al Dente Pronto is not really expensive (even without the promotion), the price ranges are mostly in the 10s to 20s. I wont say the food is excellent, in fact some are not. But then i suppose they are still acceptable to me. No you wont go all the way to the forgotton-Great-World-City just for Al Dente Pronto, but i guess if you are in the region you might just want to give it a try. And it certainly helps if you have the OCBC promotion, p.s: it last until end feb.</p><p>We had a great night chatting around, there was laughter all over the place, and at times i thought the waiter will just kick us out of the place. It was fun fun &amp; fun! Looking forward to the next <em>Yebber</em> gathering!

With competition that tough, they went <em>Halal</em>.</p><p><span id=\"more-421\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/ah%20mei%20kaya/DSC_1709.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Waking up on a sleepy Sunday morning, slowly enjoying your breakfast away from the hectic lifestyle, sipping\u00a0 a cup of coffee, nibbling on a piece of kaya toast, and slurping down the runny half-boiled eggs. The set A ($3.20) to be exact.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/ah%20mei%20kaya/DSC_1711.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Cracked the shells, we were greeted with a portrait of the rising sun. It was not just about the main character only, together with its sidekicks, the pepper and black sauce, the rising sun was slurped down in two seconds.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/ah%20mei%20kaya/DSC_1712.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>And finally, the one that all of us were waiting for. Slightly toasted, the bread was golden brown. The kaya was the one which would have make all the difference in the world. Sadly, there was something missing. The lack of a signature taste in the kaya, the whole thing was not bad but failed to cast its mark on my memory.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/ah%20mei%20kaya/DSC_1704.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>There were pratas, done on the spot by their very own in-house prata man. The taste however, failed to justify the higher price tag. You could have walk in to any other prata shops and got better yet cheaper ones. Nonetheless, the curry sauce which accompanied the prata, was the saving grace. You could get it <em>a la carte</em>, or as a set with tea or coffee.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/ah%20mei%20kaya/DSC_1701.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>With both Ah Mei and Oldtown positioned within the high district at Bukit timah, i half suspect Ya Kun might just want to open a branch there to join in the party. Which can only be good news for the residents. Ah Mei, didn\u2019t really impress dme. The widely diversified menu which also included muslim food like nasi lemek &amp; mee rebus, didn\u2019t appeal to the kaya-seeking fan in me.</p><p>Ah Mei Kaya toast<br>\n450 Upper Bukit Timah road<br>\nThe Railmall<br>\nTel: 6462 5137</p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/11/ah-mei-kaya-toast-a-different-creature-from-ya-kun/", "location": "450 Upper Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 678069", "latitude": 1.3597143},

It\u2019s all about <em>you</em> baby. Yesterday you asked me something I thought you knew. So I told you with a smile, \u2018<em>It\u2019s all about you</em>\u2018. Say \u2018if <em>you</em> made my life worthwhile it\u2019s all about you\u2019. It\u2019s all about the <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/category/dessert-enthusiast/\">company</a>, it\u2019s all about the cakes, it\u2019s all about the laughter, it\u2019s all about the fun, it\u2019s all about the sugar-rush, from the desserts.</p><p><span id=\"more-467\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0905.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0902.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0937.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It\u2019s all about pistachio and strawberry. The <strong>fraisier</strong> ($6.90++) was the first one we started with. The very subtle &amp; mild pistachio butter cream, worked for me, but it might just disappoint the pistachio purists. A simple dessert, with the almond sponge cake enveloping the butter cream. I\u2019ll pick this again, yes I will.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0941.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>On my first time trying the <strong>Strawberry shortcake</strong> ($6.50++), I was disappointed by <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/10/23/canele-patisserie-the-very-first/\">Canele\u2019s</a> rendition. Well still basically a shortcake sponge with cream and strawberry, Bakerzin\u2019s version appealed more to me. But, for people with stronger taste buds, go for other highly-flavoured cakes instead of this.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0958.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It\u2019s all about <em>New York</em>. No, you do not need to go all the way to NY just for a slice of the famous <strong>New York cheesecake</strong> ($6.50++). Possibility one of the most popular cheesecake, this one here came with a coat of tangy strawberry glaze, topped with a sole berry. Light and airy, a few of us preferred this to the stronger lemon cheesecake.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0989.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Lemon, cheese, and cake. I\u2019m talking about the <strong>Bloom cheesecake</strong> ($6.50++) of course. Cheesy flavour with a strong hint of lemon. In the battle between the supporters of the heavy-cheesy, and the light subtle dessert, I\u2019m leaning towards the light airy camp in this case. It\u2019s not that I do not like the cheesy type, but the bloom somehow was overwhelming, although I like the lemon zest.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0947.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It\u2019s all about the love of coffee, and chocolate. The <strong>Sumatra</strong> ($6.50++) coffee mousse with the combination of dark and white chocolate. I ain\u2019t a coffee lover, so it didn\u2019t quite worked out for me.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0952.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It\u2019s all about childhood, birthday, and nostalgia. I remember the time when I was a kid, eating my black forest cake to celebrate the-day-I-was-borne. The <strong>Foret Noir</strong> ($6.90++) was the biggest in slice, with chocolate flakes showered all over the chocolate almond sponge cake soaked in kirsch. You know, the only reason why I detested eating black forest cake was the presence of brandied cherries within. Why can\u2019t we do a black forest without them inside!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0954.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It\u2019s all about chocolate. It\u2019s all about chocolate baby. The sweet, o so sweet chocolate mousse with the flourless chocolate sponge. The \u201c<em>oomph</em>\u201d and \u201c<em>ahh</em>\u201d all came out. Heavenly chocolate. I can\u2019t imagine somebody who will dislike this, and chocolate. The <strong>Chocolate Amer</strong> ($6.20++) was by far, one of the best cakes among the 10 that we tried.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/bakerzin/DSC_0968.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>With crunchy walnuts, chocolate ganache, and caramelised bananas. <strong>Ambrosia</strong> ($6.50++).

Oh man, I don\u2019t know what to say, but I did that.

I carefully took a small nibble to start our foreplay, I moved downwards and craved for more, I took bigger bites; it was good, but the thing was, I\u2019m not sure whether that justified the high price I\u2019m paying for.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m a visual creature. I love sitting in nice, pretty ambience, sipping my drink and enjoying the food. I\u2019m a sucker I know.

It was hot, it was red, spicy, fiery hot. The crabmeat was overflowed generously; spicy crabmeat and linguine, I would prefer it to be slightly wetter though.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Big%20D%20grill/DSC_0365.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>And for the only dessert available, the <strong>bonet</strong> ($4).

At least, that\u2019s what he told me.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coincidentally, I had my <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2009/12/25/plan-b-by-becasse/\">first German meal</a> a few days later when I went back to Sydney from Katoomba. It was awesome, and I have been craving for German food ever since I came back to Singapore. <strong>Brotzeit German Bier Bar &amp; Restaurant</strong> was one of the few places that came to mind when I wanted to plan for a German dinner. There\u2019s currently three Brotzeit restaurant at Raffles City, 313 @ Somerset and Vivocity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-5251\"></span>Needless to say, I was very excited. If you were there that night, you\u2019d probably saw me from afar. Yes, the guy sitting near the entrance of the restaurant at Vivocity, with a big camera snapping away.</p><p>Anyway, German Pork Knuckles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, I wanted pork knuckles, and I wanted it immediately! It\u2019s not exaggerating to say that pork knuckles are the representative of German Food for me. Extremely crispy, deep-fried but not dry, hearty but not heavy, I just love every bite of the <strong>Pork Knuckle</strong> ($36). It may not look very filling, but trust me, you need a few people to finish this.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Brotzeit/Singapore_Food_Blog_Sausage.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore Food Blog - Brotzeit\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sausages platter <strong>Wustelpatte </strong>($32.50) is a great way to try a little of everything. There\u2019s spicy chicken sausages, Nurnberger pork bratwurst, mini pork cheese sausages, weisswurst sausage and garlic sausages. Half the time, I couldn\u2019t tell which was which, but who cares? We finished every single one of them.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Brotzeit/Singapore_Food_Blog_German_Food.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore Food Blog - Brotzeit\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Somehow, the crackling pork knuckles reminded me of roasted pork, and when I saw the <strong>Schweinsbraten</strong> ($29.50) on the menu, I <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">pleaded</span> commanded my friends: lets get the roasted pork! But it was quite different from what I\u2019ve imagined. I thought it\u2019d be something like the roast pork that we\u2019re so familiar with. Instead, Brotzeit\u2019s rendition was roasted pork with gravy, alongside homemade red cabbage. Even though the robust gravy added flavor to the meat, but I still preferred the crispy roasted pork.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Brotzeit/Singapore_Food_Blog_Seafood_Platter.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore Food Blog - Brotzeit\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was dazzled for a good twenty seconds the moment the Seafood platter, <strong>Fischplatte</strong> ($34.50) arrived on the table. Time seemed to slow as my senses fully captured everything on the plate; my eyes took in every single detail of the marination on the thick slices of tuna. The vibrant colors of the smoked salmon and bright-red marinated prawns also caught my attention. It was amazing to smell the white anchovies, and even more appealing to put it in my month, everything was so refreshing. Again, if you are with a good of friends, it\u2019s more like a tasting platter since everyone only gets to try a little of everything.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Brotzeit German Bier Bar &amp; Restaurant will definitely be one of the top choices when it comes to German Food in Singapore. Reservations are a must, especially when it\u2019s dinner time. There was about 7-8 of us, and for the food that we had, it wasn\u2019t particularly filling for the most of people. On hindsight, we should have order at least one more main dish to share. Anyway, I reckon the budget is about $30-40 per person if you want to get a decent filling meal, and at least in the $50s if beer is included.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s always easier to order food when there are more people, and this is particularly true for Brotzeit. There\u2019s so many items on the menu and it was a challenge going through all of them. My advise? Get a group of friends and hit Brotzeit for the Pork Knuckle, German sausages and booze. Hurry up!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where do you go for German food in Singapore? And what\u2019s the one must-try item when you are having a German dinner?</p><p><strong>Restaurant Review</strong><br>\nBrotzeit German Bier Bar &amp; Restaurant<br>\n1 Harbourfront Walk<br>\n#01-149/-151 VivoCity<br>\nTel: +65 6272 8815</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/03/13/german-restaurants-singapore/\" id=\"icon-27\" class=\"list-icon\">icon-27</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/02/17/late-night-dining-restaurants-singapore/\" id=\"icon-23\" class=\"list-icon\">icon-23</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/03/german-food-brotzeit-bier-bar-restaurant-singapore/", "location": "Money Champ @Vivocity, VivoCity, Singapore 098585", "latitude": 1.26503},

But if I must choose between Brasserie Wolf\u2019s Duck Leg Confit and Beef Bourguignon, I\u2019d go for the latter.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15144\" title=\"French Cuisine Singapore\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/French-Cuisine-Singapore.jpg\" alt=\"French Cuisine Singapore\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fork-tender Beef Bourguignon ($28) was braised to perfection. Together with the sides of Bacon, Mushroom, Baby Onions, and Carrots, the beef was <em>so good</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Seared Cod ($35) was excellent in my opinion. The simple preparation of the dish highlighted the freshness of the Cod. So much so that my dining companion was actually reluctant to share the fish.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was a shame that we were too full to continue eating. Otherwise I\u2019d definitely order the Traditional Bouillabaisse Soup ($36).</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15143\" title=\"Brasserie Wolf\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Brasserie-Wolf.jpg\" alt=\"Brasserie Wolf\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For desserts, we skipped the ubiquitous Valrhona Warm Chocolate Cake ($15) and had the Chocolate &amp; Coffee Liegeois ($13). The cold dessert was visually appealing, and the presence of Valrhona Chocolate Sauce added bonus points too. But I felt that it was nothing impressive, and did not justify the price tag. We also had a selection of macarons which were run-of-the-mill. On hindsight, we should have gone for the Creme Brulee Vanilla ($10) instead.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chef Claudio had just arrived in Singapore from London to helm <strong>Brasserie Wolf</strong>. I\u2019m certain he will slowly find his way to satisfy everyone with his straightforward French cooking.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Personally, I feel that prices are slightly steep for a causal French Bistro. But having said that, <em>Brasserie Wolf</em> serves simple and good French food. Amongst the dishes that we tried, the Traditional French Onion Soup and Beef Bourguignon are definitely worth ordering. Dessert is probably Brasserie Wolf\u2019s weakest link. I\u2019d suggest skipping it and go to <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/01/24/laurent-bernard-chocolatier-best-desserts-singapore/\">Laurent Bernard</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/12/04/canele-patisserie-chocolaterie-desserts-singapore/\">Canele Patisserie</a> to have your sweets.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are looking for French food in the Robertson Quay area, check out Brasserie Wolf and say hi to Chef Claudio.</p><p>For more recommendations, read my list of the <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/07/best-french-restaurants-food-singapore/\">Best French Restaurants in Singapore</a></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Singapore Food Blog Review</span><br>\nBrasserie Wolf<br>\n80 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-13<br>\nThe Pier @ Robertson Singapore<br>\nTel: +65 6835 7818<br>\nNote: This is an invited Media Tasting.</p><p><a id=\"icon-28\" class=\"list-icon\" href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/07/best-french-restaurants-food-singapore/\">icon-28</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/05/brasserie-wolf-french-cuisine-robertson-quay/", "location": "80 Mohamed Sultan Road, Singapore 239013", "latitude": 1.291932},

All the burgers are suppose to come out medium well, which if done correctly will leave them very juicy. <strong>The Botak\u00a0Burger</strong> alone\u00a0is $5.50, but i got it at a set at $7, den add $1 for\u00a0cheese on top. There are quite a lot of extra ingredients which you can upgrade your burger with,\u00a0egg, ham, bacons, cheese etc. Actually if you are going for beef, i feel this is a better option than the Australian Ribeye, well\u00a0cow for cow, obviously this one lose out, but then at Botak\u00a0Jones, this is good n\u2019uff.</p><p>Total Bill was $22.50 for two mains,\u00a0kind of expensive going for coffee fare standards, but then again\u00a0its not really coffee shop food. I suppose it won\u2019t hurts if you go there once in a while, so until i visit the other Ang Moh stores then.</p><p><strong>As usual, please DO leave your comments to share your experience, or your thoughts on Botak Jones.

My cravings for the Italian staple saw us ordering the <strong>Linguini Ragout Pollo</strong> ($15.90). While there wasn\u2019t any exotic ingredients, a good home-made chicken Bolognese was always a welcome. The taste of fresh tomatoes, not those cans type was a relief. The pasta section at Blue basil isn\u2019t very comprehensive, but this one, have done enough.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/blue%20basil/DSC_05151.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Addiction for ice cream &amp; baileys. A close fight between the raspberry cream brule\u00e9 and the <strong>Baileys gelato served on crushed ice &amp; baileys liqueur</strong> ($9.90), with the latter winning of course. The baileys and ice-cream expert gave her verdict that this was good stuff, so it was. The baileys gelato, were pure, and the baileys used were generous, unlike some places which served diluted versions. And eating crushed ice with gelato brought the novelty to another level.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/blue%20basil/DSC_05191.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The complimentary <strong>cappucino</strong> ($4.50) was on the house.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/blue%20basil/bluebasil2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Total bill</strong> was $48.90 for the food with a 7% GST, and no service charge. Blue basil met my expectations, with its use of the spice in almost all their dishes. Prices are affordable for the range of variety it provided, and being right in the middle of town, they offered you with a very good option, albeit you must take a 10minutes walk from Paragon. Actually i like their location because although it\u2019s in town, but not many people know about the place, and it eludes the your-own-place-feel. Well, it\u2019s certainly not a bad place for an romantic dinner, but for taking photo-wise, it isn\u2019t very friendly.

The hazelnut taste was mild, and i\u2019ll prefer it to be stronger. <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/10/06/obolo-boutique-de-patisserie/\">Obolo</a> had a stronger case for its hazelnut macarons. Nonetheless, the hazelnut was still detectable, and there\u2019s after taste of it.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Canele%20Patisserie/DSC_1470.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Milk Chocolate feullitine ($2.30)</p><p>How can anybody resisted the temptation of <strong>milk chocolate</strong>? Not me, that\u2019s for sure! The silky milk chocolate, with crunchy bites of feullitine, was one of Canele\u2019s signature flavours. There was nothing intriguing about it, just a reliable and safe option to taste the chocolate while munching on the chewy shells.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Canele%20Patisserie/DSC_1466.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Rose ($2.30)</p><p>We also picked the <strong>rose</strong> classic flavour for one of our macarons. The first taste of the lovely pinkish delight was subtle, the rose wasn\u2019t very strong. But we did questioned whether real rose was used, as it tasted like rose syrup. Nonetheless, the rose should be a crowd favourite with the ladies.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Canele%20Patisserie/DSC_1472.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Saltey caramel ($2.30)</p><p>Introducing the <strong>saltey caramel</strong> once again! Even though we chose the cafe caramel, but we couldn\u2019t miss out having the saltey caramel macarons. Like mentioned above, the salted caramel had a very unique taste, and compared to the Cafe caramel cake, this one was much better as you could taste the saltey caramel, whereby the former was overshadowed by the stronger chocolate companion.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Canele%20Patisserie/DSC_1435.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Total bill</strong> was $28.45 for 2 cakes and 4 macarons. I\u2019ve to confess, amidst all the high anticipation of Canel\u00e9, my first visit fell short of expectations. I think maybe it\u2019s a case of ordering the wrong desserts. Or because i had high hopes, which resulted in the not-as-good outcome. Such is the magic of Canele, that i\u2019ll definitely visit them again to try out the other cakes, even though the first escapade wasn\u2019t really what i want.</p><p>There\u2019s plenty of others which i\u2019ll love to try, the le royale, canele pastry, jupitar, and many more. I think the next time round, i\u2019ll probably go to the raffles city branch, since the \u201cin-thing\u201d is to be seen hanging around at their Shaw centre branch, seats are hard to get here. And one thing i noted, if the area behind that is housing <strong>The Canteen</strong> (another Les Amis restaurant), is used to expand Canel\u00e9 instead, i\u2019m pretty sure it will also fill up pretty easily.</p><p>Canel\u00e9 Patisserie chocolaterie<br>\n1 Scotts road<br>\n#01-01A Shaw Centre<br>\nTel: 6738 9020</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/01/28/best-ice-cream-singapore/\" id=\"icon-5\" class=\"list-icon\">icon-5</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/10/canele-patisserie-the-very-first/", "location": "Shaw's Child Development & Learning Centre, 24 Lynwood Grove, Singapore 358666", "latitude": 1.3470607},

Remove all the mirrors at home, get a bigger pair of jeans, or simply exercise more the next day \u2014 everyone should have their cake, and eat it.

The very distinctive <em>earl grey</em> flavour, the seemingly-smaller-scoop-than-my-previous-visit, and the milk chocolate shards.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Canele%20Patisserie/DSC_2027.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>(6) We laugh, fight, make merry and have fun</p><p>We almost fought over this, the <strong>madagascar</strong> ($8) was way too, <em>common </em>(read:plain), to worth the money. But I was proved wrong; open your eyes wide, that\u2019s vanilla beans you\u2019re looking at! <em>Ooh</em>, <em>ah</em>! That, alone, made me felt better about paying eight dollars for a scoop of ice cream. Fresh strawberries that were not very sweet, and almond crumble at the bottom to provide a crunchy texture to the smooth and soft ice cream.</p><p>(7) It is time to say bye-bye</p><p>I looked around the adjacent tables, throwing envious glances to the <em>mont blanc</em>, the <em>tiramisu</em>, the <em>macarons</em>, that the others were having. Unfortunately, the rest (on my table) did not have the same feeling as me, they never like cakes you see.</p><p>Even though we hardly see each other, well four times a year to be exact; the divergence of different routes in life that it may seems like we are strangers and drifting apart, but, we always had a good time when we met, again.</p><p>* * *</p><p>I wasn\u2019t really impressed with the main course that Canele offered, but, to be fair, I think they are priced reasonably. And if I may, I\u2019ll also like to think that the ice cream here are under-recognised; people always rave about the cakes available, but I don\u2019t think much people know that they serve good ice cream too.</p><p>After three visits, I haven\u2019t try enough of their beautiful creations yet.

Apparently you can have unlimited servings of xiaolongbao if you go for the <em>Crystal Jade Steamboat Buffet</em> at <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/07/18/guide-to-holland-village-restaurants-singapore/\">Holland Village</a>. But no thank you, I really don\u2019t fancy having twenty baskets of xiaolongbao at one go.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We shared the five dumplings between the two of us, and they were gone in an instant. I was greedy and impatient, so I dipped it with the light soy sauce and ginger and placed the whole dumpling into my mouth \u2014 that was a huge mistake. The stock gushed through and burnt my tongue when I took a bite, but it felt so good.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10200\" title=\"Zha Jiang Mian\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Zha-Jiang-Mian.jpg\" alt=\"Zha Jiang Mian\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We were stunned by the portion of the Noodle with Minced Meat &amp; Mushroom in spicy sauce ($7.50) when it arrived on the table. I liked how the spicy-sweet sauce entangled itself with the la mien.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10201\" title=\"Crystal Jade Fried Rice\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Crystal-Jade-Fried-Rice.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Jade Fried Rice\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019m not sure if my memory is playing a trick on me, but I actually prefer Din Tai Fung\u2019s fried rice. While the portion of Crystal Jade\u2019s <strong>Fried rice</strong> with prawn, chicken &amp; ham in Shanghai style ($10.80) was impressive, it lacked a certain wok-hei flavor. In short, not the best fried rice that I had before.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* * *</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s actually not difficult to understand why <strong>Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao</strong> is doing well. The food is decent, and they are reasonably priced. It is probably around $10-ish per head to have a proper dinner here. You know what? I\u2019m going to try out the Crystal Jade Palace restaurant for <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/01/11/best-dim-sum-singapore/\">dim sum</a> next.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which Crystal Jade restaurants have you been to, and between <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/07/13/imperial-treasure-singapore-ion-orchard-restaurant/\">Imperial Treasure</a> or Crystal Jade, which one do you prefer?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Restaurant Review</span><br>\nCrystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao<br>\n391 Orchard Road #04-27<br>\nNgee Ann City Singapore<br>\nTel: +65 6238 1661</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/02/17/late-night-dining-restaurants-singapore/\" id=\"icon-23\" class=\"list-icon\">icon-23</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/10/crystal-jade-restaurant-singapore-la-mian-xiao-long-bao/", "location": "391 Orchard Road, Singapore 238872", "latitude": 1.302708},

Some paid more for their expensive egg brunch, while some paid less for just bread and desserts. But generally, if you are looking to try their brunch or lunch menu, you will probably looking at 20+ per person, and that\u2019s probably excluding desserts. Choupinette has a great base of Caucasians customers, and it isn\u2019t difficult to see why for the cosy and homely decorations of the place. The name of the restaurant, and the French names of the food screams chic. It will probably be better to go on a weekday where there\u2019s less customers if you want to try this place out.</p><p>Well, just like how there will never be a perfect DSLR for either <em>Canon</em>, <em>Olympus</em> or <em>Nikon</em> users. Some of you might like <em>Nikon</em> for the design, <em>Canon</em> for its brand, <em>Olympus</em> for its nimbleness, all of us have different preferences. Similarly for Choupinette, while we were disappointed by the desserts, but the eggs on the brunch were exceptional, and you might just like the food there.

When you mention Chin Huat Live Seafood, chances are, people will think of the slogan \u201clobster bigger than little girl\u201d used in their television advertisement years ago.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chin Huat Live Seafood</strong> at Sunset Way, is of course, more than just lobsters. Besides the typical Sri Lanka crabs, they offer a huge variety of seafood and popular zichar dishes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-19801\"></span>The restaurant was pretty full when we went on a weekday for dinner. As it was just a casual family dinner, we decided to play safe and order the usual stuff like chilli crabs, deep-fried chicken, and sambal kangkong.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone knows that Chilli Crab is one of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/07/singapore-must-eats-best-food/\">must-eats in Singapore</a></span>. But to be honest, I have a love-hate relationship with it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On one hand, I really love dipping the deep-fried mantou into the savoury-sweet chilli gravy. On the other, the amount of work \u2013 from cracking a shell that\u2019s as hard as a bulletproof tank; to trying to coax the meat out from the deep end of the shell \u2013 doesn\u2019t justify all the work for so little flesh.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More than anything, I am a lazy person who doesn\u2019t like to dirty his hands just for crabs. But fine, I did it anyway. Who can resist the temptation of Chilli crab with deep-fried mantou?</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19804\" title=\"Salted Egg Yolk Crab\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Salted-Egg-Yolk-Crab.jpg\" alt=\"Salted Egg Yolk Crab\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As much as I\u2019d love to try Chin Huat\u2019s signature Golden Sauce Crab, we only had room for another crab and we went for the Salted Egg Yolk Crab ($43 per kg). It was <em>okay</em>. I felt that the salted egg yolk crab would be better if there was more gravy.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19805\" title=\"Dong Po Pork\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Dong-Po-Pork.jpg\" alt=\"Dong Po Pork\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was trying very hard to concentrate when the Dong Po Rou ($16) arrived. They were magnificent \u2013 just look at the picture above!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The others commented that the sauce was a little too sweet, but I thought that it was just nice. Then again, I have a really sweet tooth, so don\u2019t take my word for it.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19806\" title=\"Roasted Chicken\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Roasted-Chicken.jpg\" alt=\"Roasted Chicken\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Deep-fried Crispy Chicken ($12 for half) was equally good-looking.

I\u2019m rather skeptical about the zucchini initially, but it actually taste quite well together with the chicken breast sandwich in between the bread.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/caffe%20beviamo/DSC_1577.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Strawberry Shortcake ($3.5)</p><p>The <strong>strawberry shortcake</strong> rendition at Caffe Beviamo is given a make-over, not quite like your usual ones. With a big red juicy strawberry sandwich in between the pastry, it does provides an inspiration with the \u201cplaying\u201d of food by constructing them different from the norm.</p><p>The desserts are not on the menu, and its rather pick-your-own from the counter. So grab yours fast because once they are out, other different ones will be offered instead. I saw a carrot cake before we started our meal, but after we finished it\u2019s gone!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/caffe%20beviamo/DSC_1580.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Cheese Cake ($4)</p><p>The normal <strong>cheese cake</strong> at Caffe Beviamo is real good! Cheesy yet not to the extent overwhelming. The biscuit crumb layer underneath the cake provides a different dimension to the soft and fluffy cheese cake. The \u201coomph\u201d feel immediately make its presence known.</p><p>So good! And at 4 bucks, it\u2019s really a steal. Appearance-wise it looks very ordinary, but the taste is definitely not!</p><p><strong>Total bill</strong> is $31.55 for 2 person. The food and ambience at Caffe Beviamo is bona fide simple, but the simplicity is exactly the beauty of the place. Price-wise its certainly affordable in a cafe style, prices for pastas, sandwiches and salads ranges in the tens, and different varieties of toast at $4.5 each.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying the food is excellent, it isn\u2019t. However the comfort and simple food is exactly what you need sometimes after feeling jade from eating. The price won\u2019t hurt you in the pocket, and the place\u2019s nice to hang out with a couple of friends.</p><p>Desserts are excellent, although this can come to be rather a big tag since i have only tried two of their desserts. But given the prices, i think they are definitely worth a try, and i\u2019ll be going to the other one at Tanglin Mall again. </p><p>Caffe Beviamo<br>\n290 Orchard Road<br>\n#05-K3 The Paragon<br>\nTel: 6836 2535</p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/07/caffe-beviamo/", "location": "290 Orchard Road, Singapore 238859", "latitude": 1.3035359},

Even though everyone always grumbles about Mondays blues, I\u2019d think that Monday isn\u2019t as bad as Tuesday since we are fully recharged during the weekends. But Tuesday, they are neither here nor there. It isn\u2019t midweek yet, nor is it just-one-more-day-to-Friday, and obviously it isn\u2019t TGIF.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anyway, my point is: Tuesday <em>sucks</em>. So stop asking if everything is okay, because it is not. But my dear, I want to give you some hope. I want you to see the light at the end of the <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">tunnel</span> week. I\u2019m going to try and make your day better by blogging about the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">High Tea Buffet</span> at <strong>Barracks Cafe House Dempsey Road</strong>.</p><p><span id=\"more-9422\"></span>I\u2019m a sucker for <a title=\"Singapore Afternoon High Tea Buffet\" href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/08/16/singapore-afternoon-high-tea-buffet/\">Afternoon High Tea</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be it the classic English High Tea with the pretty three tier desserts, or a simple true-blue Singaporean tea\u00a0 break with Kaya toast and coffee \u2013 the fact is, all of us should enjoy our tea break. It is the period in between lunch and dinner, when we feel sleepy and grumpy. Food will never let you down, have a good feast!</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9433\" title=\"House Dempsey\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/House-Dempsey.jpg\" alt=\"House Dempsey\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From 1st July till 1st October, <strong>Barracks Cafe at House, </strong><a title=\"Dempsey road restaurants\" href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/07/04/dempsey-hill-restaurants-singapore/\">Dempsey road</a> is serving what they called the \u201c<em>Summer High Tea Buffet</em>\u201d every Thursday and Friday afternoon from 3pm \u2013 5.30pm. For $25 nett per pax, one gets to enjoy a leisure afternoon with your friends and loved ones over high tea items and a pot of tea. Now, don\u2019t your Tuesday suddenly sounds much better already?</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9431\" title=\"Singapore Afternoon High Tea\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Singapore-Afternoon-High-Tea.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore Afternoon High Tea\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the name of research purposes, I went all out and tried to taste everything. Starting with the small and nimbly Cheesecake marbled brownie, I continued with the Chicken salad sandwich, tuna &amp; shrimp sandwich, and munched a couple of the delicious cookies.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9429\" title=\"Scones\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Scones.jpg\" alt=\"Scones\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p>The scones, oh the scones.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There\u2019s no need to find any excuses to eat butter and maple syrup, I can think of 1046 reasons to eat them. The scones from Barracks cafe were slightly dry and it would be better if they were heated up. But hey, you know what? Having scones during <a title=\"Afternoon Tea Singapore\" href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/07/20/marmalade-pantry-ion-orchard-afternoon-high-tea-singapore/\">afternoon tea</a> made it legitimate for me to indulge in butter and maple syrup without feeling guilty.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9432\" title=\"3 Tier Desserts\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/3-Tier-Desserts.jpg\" alt=\"3 Tier Desserts\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9425\" title=\"House Barracks\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/House-Barracks.jpg\" alt=\"House Barracks\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p>In addition to the high tea offerings, we also ordered the <em>Red Espresso Tea Set</em> ($9.50). Note that it\u2019s a separate order and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not part</span> of the <strong>high tea buffet</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a non-tea person, I enjoyed the red latte, but it was the Brioche with the red espresso jam that was truly amazing. Initially, I thought that the tiny bottle was a kaya spread. To my surprise, it was actually made from Rooibos tea. It looked like kaya, but it tasted even better than kaya! The Brioche, oh, it was so soft and <em>super yummy</em>. I know it sounds kind of bimbo-tic, but that\u2019s the best description I can give.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Forget about the summer high tea buffet all right? Go for the Red Espresso Tea set okay? I\u2019d like to apologize for moaning out loud after I had the brioche. Oh my god.

There aren\u2019t that many spectacular sweets, but for the kind of money and the variety offered, I think it\u2019s a pretty good deal for <em>high tea buffets</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With a pot of tea, a nibble here or two, and in the company of your favorite person, the afternoon high tea at <strong>Barracks Cafe House Dempsey</strong> silently transits into dinner without anyone noticing.

But on the other, the mashed potato was more like an acquired taste; it did not work for me.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5125.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prepared in a hot pot of sorts, the Special <strong>Si Chuan chill sliced fish</strong> ($38.8) was very intimidating with the dry chili on top the thick layer of the spicy-looking chili oil. I was hesitant in picking up my spoon, but the others took up the challenge with much enthusiasm. They convinced me that it was not as hot as it appeared to be, I took a tiny nibble of the sliced fish with some gravy, although the fish was not extremely hot, but it was enough to make me sweat.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5123.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Winter melon is a firm favorite of my mom\u2019s when it comes to soup. She\u2019d boil the melon with pork ribs for many hours until the melon became so soft that it could almost dissolve in your mouth. It was almost the same case here, the <strong>Dry scallop stew with Winter melon</strong> ($26.8) had a smoothing texture, with a sweet subtle fragrance from the dry scallop.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5134.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I believe whoever that came up with the idea of deep-frying prawns must be a genius, otherwise how else do you explain something that\u2019s so simple, and yet taste so good? All of us unanimously agreed that the <strong>Deep Fried prawn</strong> wrapped with homemade sauce and potatoes ($28.8 for 8 pieces) were the highlight of the meal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chef actually peeled the potatoes into thin tiny strips, stuck them around the prawns and deep fried it until golden brown. The result? A crispy prawn ball that explodes in your mouth, so good that it reminded us of popcorn chicken. No, it\u2019s definitely much, much better than popcorn chicken.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5143.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Shanxi Steam marinated Noodle with vegetable and pork ($12.8)</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5148.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By all accounts, I\u2019m a rather safe eater. I\u2019d never touch stuff like fried insects, chicken feet, duck tongue, or durian. <strong>Chicken gristle</strong> ($16.8) seems pretty tame compared to those that I\u2019ve mentioned, anyway when you took a bite of it, <em>crunch, crunch, crunch</em>. Sensational. Although I did not really enjoyed it, but at least now I can proudly say that I have tried chicken gristle before.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5153.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What I like, without a qualm, is the robust meat found within the <em>shao bing</em>. The <strong>Special Shanxi Marinated meat in baked Pancake</strong> ($6.8) is a local delight, there\u2019s nothing fascinating about it, just a hearty pancake with lots of meat stuffed inside.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Duo%20Le/DSC_5157.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given a choice between the Shanxi Marinated meat pancake and the <strong>Spicy tenderloin, served with pancakes</strong> ($16.8, and $2.5 for one pancake), I\u2019d definitely go for the former. It\u2019s not that the spicy tenderloin wasn\u2019t good, but the tiny chunks of meat were not as satisfying as the marinated meat pancake.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will like to thank Fenix from Edelman, Natalie from Far East for the invitation to the food tasting session, and Eric for hosting us.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">* * *</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Food Outing<br>\nDate: 30th Jan<br>\nTime: 1 pm<br>\nCost: $25 nett per pax</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are keen to try out some Shanxi food, why not join us for my food outing next Sat? <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/01/16/duo-le-restaurant/\">Take a look at the menu</a>, to register for the outing, send an email to <strong>bradleyfk@gmail.com</strong>, let me know your name, contact number, and the number of pax.</p><p><strong>Restaurant Review</strong><br>\nDuo Le<br>\n181 Orchard Road<br>\n#08-09 Orchard Central<br>\nTel: 6509 8616</p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/01/duo-le-orchard-central/", "location": "Central Expressway, Singapore", "latitude": 1.3009338},

Then there are other places you go for special occasions \u2013 like a hot date, birthday celebration, or wedding anniversary.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you are looking for somewhere to have a <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/06/romantic-restaurants-best-views-singapore/\">romantic dinner</a>, <strong>Equinox Restaurant</strong> at Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford is one of those places that always come to mind. It has one of the best locations in Singapore, overlooking the beautiful city. But that aside, I also love that it is very versatile. You can bring your clients there for a business luncheon; hang out with your girlfriends over a leisure afternoon tea; or have a romantic date \u2013 it is a restaurant that is suitable for all occasions.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I recently sampled the new menu by Chef de Cuisine Lee Bennett, and it was a good meal. If you haven\u2019t yet had the chance to try Equinox, give it a shot. If you have and it has been some time, it\u2019s time to go back again.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-24078\"></span>Our amuse-bouche was a duo of lobster bisque and crab mayonnaise shooter. The lobster bisque was fantastic. If you are a fan of the smooth and creamy French soup, you must order the regular portion ($26) from the <em>ala carte</em> menu.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24084\" title=\"Salad\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Salad.jpg\" alt=\"Salad\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next we had a salad ($24) \u2013 tasting of beetroot with braeburn apple, aged balsamic dressing, St. Maure goat\u2019s cheese and toasted pine kernels. It was good, but nothing special.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24085\" title=\"Dover Sole Meuniere\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Dover-Sole-Meuniere.jpg\" alt=\"Dover Sole Meuniere\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The highlight of our meal was the 900g Dover Sole Meuniere. The fish was, without exaggerating, very very good. At $180 (sharing portion for two), it is not cheap. In fact, I think it is crazy to spend so much on fish. But the truth is, it was one of the best that I\u2019ve had, and I would save up and come back for this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24086\" title=\"Pork tenderloin\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pork-tenderloin.jpg\" alt=\"Pork tenderloin\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We also tried the Gressingham duck breast ($70), but it did not leave a strong impression. The other main course, Rhug estate tenderloin of pork ($65) was much more interesting. It was served with scotch egg, prunes, celeriac puree, and whisky sauce. I thought that the whole combination went pretty well.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24087\" title=\"cr\u00eapes suze\u00efm\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cr%C3%AApes-suze%C3%AFm.jpg\" alt=\"cr\u00eapes suze\u00efm\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After we were done with the main courses, we had cr\u00eapes suze\u00efm ($34), and it came with tableside service \u2013 the server pushed a trolley out and prepared the cr\u00eapes right in front of us. It was really fun, and I would order this just for the \u201cshow\u201d.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was followed by a seasonal cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($24), which after dipping our spoon into, we agreed was one of the best in town.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24088\" title=\"Dessert platter\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Dessert-platter.jpg\" alt=\"Dessert platter\" width=\"550\" height=\"804\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That\u2019s not all.

The restaurant is the brainchild of the duo owners, Helena and Sharon. The concept for the restaurant is like a neighbour joint, serving casual food where you can chill out and enjoy a meal without any qualms.</p><p><span id=\"more-306\"></span></p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1154.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The interior of Epicurious is surprisingly small, from the outside i thought it will be bigger. There are only three tables inside, with most of the seats in the al fresco area.</p><p>Unpretentious and comfy, Epicurious is really a place where i can sit down there all day with my friends</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1157.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The <strong>al fresco area</strong> offers a view of the river by Robertson Quay, its simple furniture make it seems as though you are having picnic out in the natural.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1149.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The food which Epicurious offers are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>comfort</strong> food, like sandwiches, salads, pasta. On weekends from 9am to 1pm, they have the <strong>brunch menu</strong> which include choices like pancakes, toast, bagel, eggs, ommelette. And i am really tempted by their brunch menu, you\u2019ll be seeing them here in the near future.</p><p>At Epicurious, there is the <strong>blackboard specials</strong>, which is not on the normal menu, and these are changed regularly to allow customers to experience different type of food.</p><p>The <strong>lunch menu</strong> does not have much selection of mains, in fact they only have three to choose from, with mostly sandwiches and pasta otherwise.</p><p>For <strong>dinner</strong>, the menu is a different one all together, with starters like beef carpaccio, smoked salmon tartare, to main course like their signature epicurious burger, and there are also quite a variety of grills to choose from. Price ranges from 10s to 20s.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1164.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Turkey Breast Sandwich ($9.50)</p><p><strong>Turkey Breast</strong> with roasted bell pepper and havarti cheese. The sandwiches are all freshly made with lettuce, tomato, and cucumber, with choices of country-style white or wholemeal sunflower bread.</p><p>The turkey breast sandwich is fairly good, served with keropok.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1174.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Spaghetti vietnamese chicken bolognaise ($14)</p><p>The <strong>chicken bolognaise spaghetti</strong> is served with cheese flakes, your good old reliable fix of pasta.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1176.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Asian Sloppy Joe ($12)</p><p>Pork and beef mince with hoisin and lime. The <strong>Asian Sloppy Joe</strong> is under the blackboard special for sandwich. The unique name caught our attention, and the sandwich does not disappoint.</p><p>The pork and beef mince combination creates a rather distinctive taste, slightly sweet and spicy.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1182.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Epicurious Burger ($18)</p><p>House-made beef patty with saut\u00e9ed onions, mushrooms and fries. The <strong>Epicurious Burger</strong> is the signature dish of the restaurant, having heard many good things about the burger, it is inevitable that this is a must-try dish when you visit epicurious.</p><p>Although i just had burger at Seah Street Deli the previous day, but i have no qualms tasting the epicurious burger. And indeed, the Epicurious Burger is the star of the show, the beef done medium-rare, is tender and retains the juiciness of the meat.</p><p>And you can choose to add cheese, bacon or a fried egg for $2 each, or $4 for all three. But i choose to serve my burger the original way without any toppings.</p><p>I like the fries too, which comes with cheese flakes, the overall taste is buttery and cheesy!</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1191.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Apple crumble with vanilla ice cream ($7)</p><p>The <strong>Apple crumble with vanilla ice cream</strong> is recommended to us by Helena the owner of Epicurious. Now who can finish a meal without having desserts? Definitely not me! The apple crumble is sour-sweet, and the taste of it together with ice cream does it for us.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1195.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Bread and butter pudding with custard ($8)</p><p>The <strong>bread and butter pudding</strong> is also another of their more popular desserts, the way to eat it is by dipping the pudding into the custard, but i preferred to taste the bread and butter pudding on its own.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/epicurious/DSC_1201.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Carrot Cake ($5)</p><p>A slice of the <strong>Carrot cake</strong> is enough for anyone to end their meal on a high, and the cake certainly taste good here. With a layer of cheese on top of the carrot cake, the effect is a melt-in-your-month. The cheese is relatively light and does not overwhelms the carrot cake.</p><p><strong>Total bill</strong> is $82.48 for 4 mains and 3 desserts. However, Helena kindly has the desserts on the house, so the total bill is $64.90 instead.</p><p>The owner Helena is friendly and warm, we had a chat and she explain the concept of Epicurious to us. So if you saw her at the restaurant, do not hesitate to have a chat with her!</p><p>The current location however is a tad too small, and cannot serve more customer. But then again this can be a double edge sword, more seats serves more customers, but in the process you might just lose the wonderful ambiance of the place.</p><p>And by the way, Helena and Sharon have recently opened another fusion western-local restaurant, <strong>Persimmion</strong> which is located at the Link Hotel. Do give them a try if you pass by Tiong Bahru area.</p><p>Epicurious is one place which i\u2019ll gladly return again to try out their brunch and dinner menu. The reason is simple, Epicurious serves casual food, the price will not hurt your wallet, and the ambiance of the place is relaxing. Despite my usual practice of not repeating visits to a same restaurant, i\u2019ll bend the rule this time, for <strong>Epicurious</strong>!</p><p>Epicurious<br>\n60 Robertson Quay<br>\n#01-02 The Quayside<br>\nTel: 6734 7720</p><p>Epicurious is listed as one of ladyironchef\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/category/favorite-restaurants-singapore/\">favorite restaurants in Singapore</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/06/epicurious-cafe-burger/", "location": "60 Robertson Quay, Singapore 238252", "latitude": 1.290086},

East Ocean\u2019s rendition was pretty good, but I don\u2019t think that it is the <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/09/best-custard-bun-liu-sha-bao-singapore/\">best custard bun</a> that I\u2019ve had.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19077\" title=\"Fried Prawn Dumpling\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Fried-Prawn-Dumpling.jpg\" alt=\"Fried Prawn Dumpling\" width=\"550\" height=\"826\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other dim sum that we had include: Mini Crispy Egg Tarts ($5.8), Scallop Tofu ($5.8), Pan-fried carrot cake ($4.8), Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($3.5) and Deep-fried Crispy Prawn Dumping ($5.8).</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19078\" title=\"Siew Mai\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Siew-Mai.jpg\" alt=\"Siew Mai\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dim sum at <strong>East Ocean Teochew Restauran</strong>t is not particularly outstanding. Moreover, prices are about the same as some of my <em>favourite dim sum restaurants</em> like <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/07/royal-china-restaurant-raffles-hotel-singapore/\">Royal China</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/09/paradise-pavilion-restaurant-marina-bay-link-mall/\">Paradise Pavilion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/01/yan-ting-singapore-best-dim-sum/\">Yan Ting</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having said that, East Ocean has a nostalgic feel, and this probably explains why it is so popular. It is quite fun to order directly from the dim sum trays going around. But like <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/10/red-star-chinese-restaurant-dim-sum/\">Red Star restaurant</a>, the queue is really long during weekends. I won\u2019t go back just for the dim sum, but I think it is a nice place to bring your friends for the dim sum trolley experience.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Singapore Food Blog Review</span><br>\nEast Ocean Teochew Restaurant<br>\n1 Scotts Road #02-18 Shaw Centre<br>\nTel: +65 6235 9088<br>\nWeekday: 11.30am \u2013 3pm, 6pm \u2013 11pm<br>\nWeekend &amp; PH: 10.30am \u2013 3pm, 6pm \u2013 11pm</p><p>For more recommendations, read my list of the <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/01/best-dim-sum-singapore/\">best dim sum restaurants in Singapore</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/10/east-ocean-teochew-restaurant-singapore/", "location": "Shaw's Child Development & Learning Centre, 24 Lynwood Grove, Singapore 358666", "latitude": 1.3470607},

And I was impressed within five minutes after arriving, the toilets have this amazing view \u2013 it\u2019s even better than the ones in 6 star hotels!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-1079\"></span>The beauty of the <strong>traditional soya smoked fish</strong> ($10) lies in the simplicity of it; the use of soya sauce to enhance the sweetness of the delicate fish.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0406.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First thoughts, <em>wow</em>, it\u2019s my favorite sweet &amp; sour pork! Until someone pointed out it was actually <em>youtiao</em>. The <strong>crispy dough stuffed with seafood mousse</strong> ($8), was drizzled with the appetizing sweet &amp; sour sauce. Who will have thought that <em>youtiao</em> can taste so good!</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0419.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>From afar, I smelt blood. And suddenly I felt awaken deep inside. I want blood, give me the pig liver!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <strong>Spinach and pork liver soup</strong> ($8 per portion) is one of the more delicious soup that I had in a while (other than my mom\u2019s homecook soup). It\u2019s definitely no easy task to prepare liver; if you under cook it, the surface will be too raw, while if you leave it for too long the whole thing will be hard and tasteless. The liver, I have to say, was lovely; it was done just right with a pinkish tinge in the middle.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0463.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Paper wrapped salt-baked chicken ($24 whole chicken)</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0432.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0426.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know every year during relatives gathering, I\u2019m always known as the-boy-who-love-fish, so i was quite excited to see the <strong>steamed white pomfret</strong> ($48) on our table. A restaurant wouldn\u2019t dare to serve steamed fish unless it\u2019s very fresh, or do they? Unfortunately there will be no answer because we were doing the programme recording halfway when the fish arrived. And it was already cold when they distributed it into individual portions after we finished.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0436.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I like prawns.

Well, I like to eat them but I\u2019m a lazy person when it comes to shelling prawns. <strong>King Caramelized King Prawns Har Lok</strong> ($26 per portion 2 pcs)</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0467.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If there\u2019s one thing that I can eat everyday with white rice, it would definitely be the shrimp omelette. A fried egg on its own will never taste as nice as one that has shrimp. The <strong>Old fashioned Whampoo fried noodles</strong> ($20 per portion) were served with eggs and shrimp on top, while I enjoyed every bit of the egg, the crunchy shrimp came across as a tad too salty.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0388.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Empress Jade prides itself on serving heritage Chinese food \u2013 the taste of 1970s. I have to agree that the food evokes nostalgic memories of childhood but prices seem slightly steep when you are paying for home cook food. Still, It is a good place where you can impress your date and his/her family. Getting up to Mount Faber might be a hassle if you are not driving, fortunately there\u2019s free shutter bus going up every 30 minutes from Harbourfront Tower 2.</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/1%20October/Jewel%20box/DSC_0385.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I will like to thank <em>Jiafa &amp; Peifen</em> from YES 93.3 for inviting me to join them on the show.

This rather turn us off as we needed the laptop for some discussions, and we even contemplate leaving to find another place which allow us the use of powerpoint. But we decided to stay, have\u00a0some dim-sum and get off.</p><p>Well, thats the main issue, if they had allowed us to use the powerpoint, I believe we\u2019ll have stay longer and order more Dim Sum, but due to the fact that we aren\u2019t allow to use, we order just\u00a0about 7 Dim Sum between the two of us.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://s260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/fortunate%20yum%20cha/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5562.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/fortunate%20yum%20cha/IMG_5562.jpg\" alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\"></a></p><p>Another issue which we encountered was that the staff told us that the Dim Sum promotion from 3-5pm will be only 30% instead of 50% which we saw on the newspaper, because the 50% is for Dim Sum during 8-10am. We accepted it without much questioning because there was still 30% discount anyway.</p><p>But shortly after that, when the assistant manager passed by, I inquire her on the promotion and she told me it was 50% during 3-5pm also. Well, speak of double standards.</p><p>Oh ya, and\u00a0as the place wasn\u2019t really crowded, they didn\u2019t have their usual staff pushing the trolley around to offer Dim Sum.

This one is good, egg crustard underneath the breaded top. Every spoonful of egg crustard taste warm, like straight from the oven. We felt that it\u2019s rather similar to whats more commonly known to us, egg tarts.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://s260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/friends/?action=view&amp;current=DSC02953.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"width: 495px; height: 394px;\" src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/friends/DSC02953.jpg\" alt=\"Photobucket\" width=\"612\" height=\"497\" border=\"0\"></a></p><p>Total bill for two executive set lunch was $60.6, under the 1-for-1 promotion, we paid $31.70 for the delightful lunch. The set lunch and dinner at <em>Friends</em> are definitely value-for-money, and should worth your try unless you want to go for the <em>a la carte</em> menu. The service-wise are definitely one of the better ones which i encountered on my food experience so far, the staff are polite, knowledgable and a smile is always on their face which make diners feel welcome.</p><p>By the way, we took slightly more than 1 half hours to finish our lunch, so i thought it might not be so good if you visit <em>Friends</em> during your lunch work break. This is one place where they waited for you to finish the starter before serving on the soup, the main, the dessert and the drink. So really it all depends on how fast you approach your dishes. My companion and I were starving when we start the meal with the salad and soup, so we were wondering when will then they served the main course. Well, if the main course is what you want, advice will be to finish the starters fast and get on with the main.</p><p>All in all, the dining experience at Friends is no doubt a pleasant one, which my companion and i both very much enjoyed. I would say this is the place where you can really have your Casual Fine Dining without really burning a hole in your pocket. For people who felt that fine-dining equates to dress-up, this is not a issue at <em>Friends.</em> Whether you are decked out in suits and ties, or your comfy jeans &amp; t-shirts, you\u2019ll be welcome at <em>Friends</em> all the same. On a side note, if you are driving, remember to call the restaurant for directions, as free private parking are available for diners. The next visit to <em>Friends</em> again, will be for their executive set dinner, or <em>A la carte</em> menu. And lastly i\u2019ll like to thank my companion for accompanying me on this lovely lunch. In the company of a good friend, it just makes the meal at <em>Friends</em> better.</p><p>293 Holland Road #02-04<br>\nJelita<br>\nTel: 64631011</p><p>\u201d Modern European Cuisine at its finest \u201c</p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/02/friends-jelita/", "location": "Jalan Jelita, Singapore", "latitude": 1.316123},

  {"rating": [], "description": ["In Singapore, a city full of amazing restaurants, it really takes something outstanding to make me sit up and take notice. I am just going to say this once: visit ", " \u2013 a Spanish tapas bar at Robertson Quay \u2013 before it gets too popular. Make a booking, and go there soon.", "If you are into ", ", I can safely say that this is one place you must try.", "During my first visit two months back, the crowd was quite a sight. By  coincidence, there was a restaurant owner, executive chef from a  restaurant group, and Singapore\u2019s top food critic from Straits Times,  dining in the same time. It was completely unplanned, and felt like a  mini reunion for everyone.", "The bar itself is small, with 20 seats along a narrow counter. Upon stepping inside, I fell in love with the place, and I knew immediately tat it was going to do very well. It was a multi-sensory experience for me: the music, the people, the vibe, the smell, the clanking of cast-iron pans, the heat from the Josper grill\u2026", "We started with the Iberican secret ($16) which came highly recommended and the sous vide pork was superb! It was tender, fat, and very juicy.", "During my visit to Barcelona last year, I felt let down that most of the squid ink paellas that we tried were mediocre. So I took a cautious approach when facing Foodbar Dada\u2019s black mediterranean rice ($8). After trying it, I dare say it was better than most of the ones that I\u2019ve had before. The rice was flavourful and cooked to the right doneness of what you would expect from a good paella.", "I wasn\u2019t very keen to try the watermelon gazpacho ($12) as I was not a fan of cold soup, until Foodbar Dada\u2019s rendition changed that. It was light, and very refreshing. That said, I would probably order this just once as there are too many items on the menu to choose from.", "The best dish of the night \u2013 and something I would return to Foodbar  Dada again and again \u2013 is the Josper mini squid ($18) cooked with olive oil, salt,  pepper, and egg. It was simple, but so so good. Definitely a dish that you must order!", "We decided to push our luck and go for the potato bravas ($6). Here, it was done slightly refined, with four cubes of potatoes on a nice elongated plate. It was very from the usual potato bravas, but I have to give credit to the chefs for the presentation.", "On the second visit, we had the same baby squid and black squid ink rice, and I am happy to say that the quality of both dishes were still very good.", "I was disappointed to see that they removed salmon from the menu, as I remembered it to be nicely-seared, and paired with heavenly sweet grapes and a well-balanced sauce.", "In place of it was the grilled seabass ($18), which my dining companion noted that the chef managed to maintain the integrity of the fish by not over-complicating it. I thought it was decent, but nothing to write home about.", "Josper razor clams ($18) \u2013 with diced tomatoes, onions, olive oil, and lime \u2013 while good, was slightly overcooked, and it paled in comparison to the signature baby squid.", "We also had the cod puffs ($12) \u2013 a new special item on the menu \u2013 which is essentially a savoury puff pastry filled with cod bits.", "Next up was the 150g Josper steak ($30), accompanied by red pepper, pumpkin, and peas. Again, a piece of good meat seasoned well with sea salt, and prepared to a high level in the Josper grill.", "For desserts, we were puzzled that the souffle ($12) did not rise as much as it should, and it had a molten chocolate-y centre. It was more like a chocolate lava cake than souffle. Not that we were complaining, it was a sweet ending for our wonderful meal.", "The food at Foodbar Dada is not rocket-science. They use fresh produce, well-seasoned with good quality olive oil, maldon sea salt, and expertly-cooked in Josper grill.

I am just going to say this once: visit <strong>Foodbar Dada</strong> \u2013 a Spanish tapas bar at Robertson Quay \u2013 before it gets too popular. Make a booking, and go there soon.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are into <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/10/best-spanish-restaurants-food-singapore/\">Spanish tapas</a>, I can safely say that this is one place you must try.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"more-24598\"></span>During my first visit two months back, the crowd was quite a sight. By  coincidence, there was a restaurant owner, executive chef from a  restaurant group, and Singapore\u2019s top food critic from Straits Times,  dining in the same time. It was completely unplanned, and felt like a  mini reunion for everyone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24875\" title=\"Tapas Bar\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Tapas-Bar.jpg\" alt=\"Tapas Bar\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bar itself is small, with 20 seats along a narrow counter. Upon stepping inside, I fell in love with the place, and I knew immediately tat it was going to do very well. It was a multi-sensory experience for me: the music, the people, the vibe, the smell, the clanking of cast-iron pans, the heat from the Josper grill\u2026</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We started with the Iberican secret ($16) which came highly recommended and the sous vide pork was superb! It was tender, fat, and very juicy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24882\" title=\"Squid Ink Rice\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Squid-Ink-Rice.jpg\" alt=\"Squid Ink Rice\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During my visit to Barcelona last year, I felt let down that most of the squid ink paellas that we tried were mediocre. So I took a cautious approach when facing Foodbar Dada\u2019s black mediterranean rice ($8). After trying it, I dare say it was better than most of the ones that I\u2019ve had before. The rice was flavourful and cooked to the right doneness of what you would expect from a good paella.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24876\" title=\"Watermelon Gazpacho\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Watermelon-Gazpacho.jpg\" alt=\"Watermelon Gazpacho\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I wasn\u2019t very keen to try the watermelon gazpacho ($12) as I was not a fan of cold soup, until Foodbar Dada\u2019s rendition changed that. It was light, and very refreshing. That said, I would probably order this just once as there are too many items on the menu to choose from.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24877\" title=\"Baby Squid\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Baby-Squid.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Squid\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best dish of the night \u2013 and something I would return to Foodbar  Dada again and again \u2013 is the Josper mini squid ($18) cooked with olive oil, salt,  pepper, and egg. It was simple, but so so good. Definitely a dish that you must order!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24878\" title=\"Potato bravas\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Potato-bravas.jpg\" alt=\"Potato bravas\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We decided to push our luck and go for the potato bravas ($6). Here, it was done slightly refined, with four cubes of potatoes on a nice elongated plate. It was very from the usual potato bravas, but I have to give credit to the chefs for the presentation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the second visit, we had the same baby squid and black squid ink rice, and I am happy to say that the quality of both dishes were still very good.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was disappointed to see that they removed salmon from the menu, as I remembered it to be nicely-seared, and paired with heavenly sweet grapes and a well-balanced sauce.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24879\" title=\"Seabass\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seabass.jpg\" alt=\"Seabass\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In place of it was the grilled seabass ($18), which my dining companion noted that the chef managed to maintain the integrity of the fish by not over-complicating it. I thought it was decent, but nothing to write home about.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24880\" title=\"Razor Clams\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Razor-Clams.jpg\" alt=\"Razor Clams\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Josper razor clams ($18) \u2013 with diced tomatoes, onions, olive oil, and lime \u2013 while good, was slightly overcooked, and it paled in comparison to the signature baby squid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We also had the cod puffs ($12) \u2013 a new special item on the menu \u2013 which is essentially a savoury puff pastry filled with cod bits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24881\" title=\"Steak\" src=\"http://cdn.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Steak.jpg\" alt=\"Steak\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next up was the 150g Josper steak ($30), accompanied by red pepper, pumpkin, and peas. Again, a piece of good meat seasoned well with sea salt, and prepared to a high level in the Josper grill.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For desserts, we were puzzled that the souffle ($12) did not rise as much as it should, and it had a molten chocolate-y centre. It was more like a chocolate lava cake than souffle. Not that we were complaining, it was a sweet ending for our wonderful meal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The food at Foodbar Dada is not rocket-science. They use fresh produce, well-seasoned with good quality olive oil, maldon sea salt, and expertly-cooked in Josper grill. If budget is a consideration, prices here are significantly lower than the other top Spanish tapas restaurants in Singapore.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It might seem that I raved too much about Foodbar Dada, and the last thing I want to do is to set your expectations too high. But trust me on this, Foodbar Dada is worth a visit.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019d go so far as to say it is one of the best new restaurants to open in Singapore this year.

The Picardy Monster Beef Burger ($16.90 + $1 for each additional topping) cost twenty bucks after the addition of four toppings (Bacon, egg, caramelized onions and mushroom).

There\u2019s really nothing better than the sizzling sound of wagyu beef over the red-hot charcoal grill.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The manager suggested the Fuku Set ($179/2pax, $249/3pax, $309/4pax) which comes with assorted kimchee, aburi bacon, choice of salad, assorted mushroom, wagyu fillet steak, wagyu karubi, wagyu rump cap, kurobuta pork collar, duck breast, gindara miso foil grill, ishiyaki mentaiko and a choice of dessert. There is also the Warai set ($149/2pax, $209/3pax, $269/4pax) which is slightly more affordable and comes with choices like lamb chop, wagyu tongue, and wagyu nakaochi.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17874\" title=\"Salad\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Salad.jpg\" alt=\"Salad\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the Horenso Salad at <em>Gyu-Kaku restaurant</em>, which is essentially a Japanese style Spinach salad topped with bacon and creamy sesame dressing. If it was up to me, I\u2019d call this the awesome-Japanese-salad.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17875\" title=\"Ishiyaki Mentaiko\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ishiyaki-Mentaiko.jpg\" alt=\"Ishiyaki Mentaiko\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After finishing the fantastic salad, we continued with the assorted kimchee, aburi bacon and the Japanese stone grill rice. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to them, though. I was distracted by the huge plate of wagyu-goodness on the table\u2026</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17878\" title=\"Japanese BBQ\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Japanese-BBQ.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese BBQ\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I ate a slice of beef. Two. Three. And then half the plate was gone. It was impossible to slow down. They were so good. Oh my god. A piece of Wagyu fillet steak, a bite of wagyu karubi, a mouthful of wagyu rump cap \u2013 I can die without regrets now.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Halfway through the meal, we shifted our focus to the kurobuta pork collar, duck breast and gindara. The grilled cod was not bad, but I felt that it was a distraction from the beef. Who needs cod when you can have wagyu beef? The same goes for kurobuta pork collar and duck breast. Still, everything was gone in a flash. More meat please!</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17877\" title=\"Wagyu Brisket\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Wagyu-Brisket.jpg\" alt=\"Wagyu Brisket\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The servings of the Fuku set should be enough for most people, but my brother is a big meat eater, so we ordered more food from the <em>ala carte</em> menu.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If I had eaten the Wagyu Brisket ($13.9/small, $19.9/large) first, it might have tasted fantastic, but there was no turning back after we had the wagyu fillet steak and rump cap.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17876\" title=\"Wagyu Ribeye Steak\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Wagyu-Ribeye-Steak.jpg\" alt=\"Wagyu Ribeye Steak\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though we already had a lot of meat, it was impossible to resist the 200g Wagyu ribeye steak ($89.9). Our bellies were bursting when we were done with the steak. This is the reason why I can never be a vegetarian.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17879\" title=\"Pudding\" src=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Pudding.jpg\" alt=\"Pudding\" width=\"550\" height=\"827\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was quite amazed that we didn\u2019t smell like BBQ after finishing dinner. The air ventilation of the restaurant was very good; the fumes from the BBQ were ventilated efficiently through the vents. It was also great that the staff came along often to change the grill plate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Gyu Kaku Japanese BBQ restaurant</strong> is not cheap. But it serves good quality meat, and I like the fact that you won\u2019t smell like BBQ after a meal. I will definitely come back when I am craving for wagyu beef.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Singapore Food Blog Review</span><br>\nGyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ Restaurant<br>\n29 Lorong Mambong<br><a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/07/guide-to-holland-village-restaurants-singapore/\">Holland Village</a><br>\nTel: +65 6466 4001</p><p>30 Victoria Street<br>\n#01-01/03 Chijmes<br>\nTel: +65 6333 4001</p><p>81 Clemenceau Avenue<br>\n#01-18/19 UE Square<br>\nTel: +65 6733 4001</p><p>Note: This was an invited media tasting.</p><p>For more recommendations, please read my list of <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/04/best-japanese-restaurant-singapore/\">Japanese Restaurants in Singapore</a></p><p><a id=\"icon-30\" class=\"list-icon\" href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2010/04/19/best-japanese-restaurant-singapore/\">icon-30</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2011/08/gyu-kaku-japanese-bbq-yakiniku-restaurant/", "location": "81 Clemenceau Avenue, Singapore 239917", "latitude": 1.291734},

Anyone try before mind letting me know whether it\u2019s good?</p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Gelare/DSC_0104.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Waffle with single scoop Tiramisu ice cream ($6.90)</p><p>Just stick to what Gel\u00e1re is good at, waffles. There was a choice whether you want to add on 20 cents to change the waffle to chocolate chip waffles, but we sticked with the normal ones.</p><p>The choice of toppings will be either chocolate sauce or maple syrup, and the option for having cream or no cream.</p><p>I liked my <strong>Ti-ra-mi-su ice cream waffles</strong>. But its actually quite soft, i\u2019m not sure whether good waffles are meant to be soft, but i have a penchant for crispier waffles, like the one i had at <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/01/13/haato/\">Haato\u2019s</a></p><p><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/Gelare/DSC_0111.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Waffle with single scoop Pistachio gelare ($6.90)</p><p>The <strong>Pistachio gelare</strong> here wasn\u2019t to my friend\u2019s liking. Pistachio is a kind of nut just in case you have no idea, like me. My friend like the soft waffles though, i guess everybody has different preference.</p><p>And we concluded that the waffles will taste much nicer without the whipped cream, and the chocolate sauce only hinder the taste of the ice cream.</p><p><strong>Total Bill</strong> for 2 waffles is $13.80, on tuesday the waffles single scoop ice cream at $6.90 are considered reasonable i guess, but even the normal price ten bucks for it, i won\u2019t touch it.</p><p>Haato\u2019s waffle with single scoop ice cream is at $6, everyday. I guess thats the place to fulfill my waffles cravings until a better place comes about.</p><p>And on ya, we went to <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/05/21/bratwurst-shop/\">Bratwurst shop</a> at the basement of Plaza Singapura for sausages after this!</p><p>Gel\u00e1re<br>\n68 Orchard Road<br>\n#05-20 Plaza Singapura<br>\nTel: 6338 4023</p><p>\u201d Only on Tuedays, Waffles day! \u201c</p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2008/05/gelare/", "location": "5 Lorong 20 Geylang, Singapore", "latitude": 1.3127447},

Perfect!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/graze/DSC_0407.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The idea of <em>big-breakfast</em> was clearly conceptualise in <strong>the cast iron pan</strong> ($20). With the best of everything, bratwurst sausages, smoked bacon, mushroom, tomato, country potato, fried eggs, baked beans, and plum chili salsa. They clearly could read my mind, everything was my favourite, and it came sizzling on the hot pan. And oh yes, I forget to mention how good the mushrooms were! While prices might be slightly steep, and the portions didn\u2019t seem that big, let me assured you, the two of us couldn\u2019t finish everything on this pan.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/ladyironchef/graze/DSC_0431.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Total bill</strong> was $50.61 for brunch. Contrary to what some people might have say about Graze, I found the service from the staff to be good, they were attentive and friendly without being over-disturbing, and even offered to get me a small chair to put my bag after I left it on the floor. The combination of superb ambience, good service, and a lovely brunch meant that even though prices are slightly steep, I will not hesitate to go back again. I want to try the pancakes and waffles the next time round. <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/category/see-you-there/\">See you there!</a></p><p>Graze<br>\n4 Rochester Park<br>\nTel: 6775 9000<br>\nWebsite <a href=\"http://www.graze.com.sg/main/\">here</a></p><p>Graze is listed as one of ladyironchef\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ladyironchef.com/category/favorite-restaurants-singapore/\">favorite restaurants in Singapore</a></p>", "link": "http://www.ladyironchef.com/2009/03/graze-rochester-park-brunch/", "location": "4 Rochester Park, Singapore 139215", "latitude": 1.304104},
